### [Overview](https://pocketbase.io/docs/authentication/\#overview)

A single client is considered authenticated as long as it sends valid
`Authorization:YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN` header with the request.

The PocketBase Web APIs are fully stateless and there are no sessions in the traditional sense (even the
tokens are not stored in the database).

Because there are no sessions and we don't store the tokens on the server there is also no logout
endpoint. To "logout" a user you can simply disregard the token from your local state (aka.
`pb.authStore.clear()` if you use the SDKs).

The auth token could be generated either through the specific auth collection Web APIs or programmatically
via Go/JS.

All allowed auth collection methods can be configured individually from the specific auth collection
options.

Note that PocketBase admins (aka. `_superusers`) are similar to the regular auth
collection records with 2 caveats:

- OAuth2 is not supported as auth method for the `_superusers` collection
- Superusers can access and modify anything (collection API rules are ignored)

### [Authenticate with password](https://pocketbase.io/docs/authentication/\#authenticate-with-password)

To authenticate with password you must enable the _Identity/Password_ auth collection option
_(see also_
_[Web API reference](https://pocketbase.io/docs/api-records/#auth-with-password)_
_)_.

The default identity field is the `email` but you can configure any other unique field like
"username" (it must have a UNIQUE index).

JavaScript

Dart

`import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';
const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
...
const authData = await pb.collection("users").authWithPassword('test@example.com', '1234567890');
// after the above you can also access the auth data from the authStore
console.log(pb.authStore.isValid);
console.log(pb.authStore.token);
console.log(pb.authStore.record.id);
// "logout" the last authenticated record
pb.authStore.clear();`

`import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart';
final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
...
final authData = await pb.collection("users").authWithPassword('test@example.com', '1234567890');
// after the above you can also access the auth data from the authStore
print(pb.authStore.isValid);
print(pb.authStore.token);
print(pb.authStore.record.id);
// "logout" the last authenticated record
pb.authStore.clear();`

### [Authenticate with OTP](https://pocketbase.io/docs/authentication/\#authenticate-with-otp)

To authenticate with email code you must enable the _One-time password (OTP)_
auth collection option
_(see also_
_[Web API reference](https://pocketbase.io/docs/api-records/#auth-with-otp)_
_)_.

The usual flow is the user typing manually the received password from their email but you can also
adjust the default email template from the collection options and add a url containing the OTP and its
id as query parameters
_(you have access to `{OTP}` and `{OTP_ID}` placeholders)_.

Note that when requesting an OTP we return an `otpId` even if a user with the provided email
doesn't exist as a very rudimentary enumeration protection (it doesn't create or send anything).

On successful OTP validation, by default the related user email will be automatically marked as
"verified".

Keep in mind that OTP as a standalone authentication method could be less secure compared to the
other methods because the generated password is usually 0-9 digits and there is a risk of it being
guessed or enumerated (especially when a longer duration time is configured).

For security critical applications OTP is recommended to be used in combination with the other
auth methods and the [Multi-factor authentication](https://pocketbase.io/docs/authentication/#multi-factor-authentication) option.

JavaScript

Dart

`import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';
const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
...
// send OTP email to the provided auth record
const result = await pb.collection('users').requestOTP('test@example.com');
// ... show a screen/popup to enter the password from the email ...
// authenticate with the requested OTP id and the email password
const authData = await pb.collection('users').authWithOTP(result.otpId, "YOUR_OTP");
// after the above you can also access the auth data from the authStore
console.log(pb.authStore.isValid);
console.log(pb.authStore.token);
console.log(pb.authStore.record.id);
// "logout"
pb.authStore.clear();`

`import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart';
final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
...
// send OTP email to the provided auth record
final result = await pb.collection('users').requestOTP('test@example.com');
// ... show a screen/popup to enter the password from the email ...
// authenticate with the requested OTP id and the email password
final authData = await pb.collection('users').authWithOTP(result.otpId, "YOUR_OTP");
// after the above you can also access the auth data from the authStore
print(pb.authStore.isValid);
print(pb.authStore.token);
print(pb.authStore.record.id);
// "logout"
pb.authStore.clear();`

### [Authenticate with OAuth2](https://pocketbase.io/docs/authentication/\#authenticate-with-oauth2)

You can also authenticate your users with an OAuth2 provider (Google, GitHub, Microsoft, etc.). See the
section below for example integrations.

Before starting, you'll need to create an OAuth2 app in the provider's dashboard in order to get a
**Client Id** and **Client Secret**, and register a redirect URL
.

Once you have obtained the **Client Id** and **Client Secret**, you can
enable and configure the provider from your PocketBase auth collection options ( _PocketBase > Collections > {YOUR\_COLLECTION} > Edit collection (settings cogwheel) > Options_
_\> OAuth2_).

All in one ( _recommended_)Manual code exchange

This method handles everything within a single call without having to define custom redirects,
deeplinks or even page reload.

**When creating your OAuth2 app, for a callback/redirect URL you have to use the**
**`https://yourdomain.com/api/oauth2-redirect`**
( _or when testing locally - `http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/oauth2-redirect`_).

JavaScript

Dart

`import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';
const pb = new PocketBase('https://pocketbase.io');
...
// This method initializes a one-off realtime subscription and will
// open a popup window with the OAuth2 vendor page to authenticate.
//
// Once the external OAuth2 sign-in/sign-up flow is completed, the popup
// window will be automatically closed and the OAuth2 data sent back
// to the user through the previously established realtime connection.
//
// If the popup is being blocked on Safari, you can try the suggestion from:
// https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/discussions/2429#discussioncomment-5943061.
const authData = await pb.collection('users').authWithOAuth2({ provider: 'google' });
// after the above you can also access the auth data from the authStore
console.log(pb.authStore.isValid);
console.log(pb.authStore.token);
console.log(pb.authStore.record.id);
// "logout" the last authenticated record
pb.authStore.clear();`

`import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart';
import 'package:url_launcher/url_launcher.dart';
final pb = PocketBase('https://pocketbase.io');
...
// This method initializes a one-off realtime subscription and will
// call the provided urlCallback with the OAuth2 vendor url to authenticate.
//
// Once the external OAuth2 sign-in/sign-up flow is completed, the browser
// window will be automatically closed and the OAuth2 data sent back
// to the user through the previously established realtime connection.
final authData = await pb.collection('users').authWithOAuth2('google', (url) async {
// or use something like flutter_custom_tabs to make the transitions between native and web content more seamless
await launchUrl(url);
});
// after the above you can also access the auth data from the authStore
print(pb.authStore.isValid);
print(pb.authStore.token);
print(pb.authStore.record.id);
// "logout" the last authenticated record
pb.authStore.clear();`

When authenticating manually with OAuth2 code you'll need 2 endpoints:

- somewhere to show the "Login with ..." links
- somewhere to handle the provider's redirect in order to exchange the auth code for token

Here is a simple web example:

1. **Links page**
    (e.g. https://127.0.0.1:8090 serving `pb_public/index.html`):

``<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
       <meta charset="utf-8" />
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
       <title>OAuth2 links page</title>
       <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.7.1.slim.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
       <ul id="list">
           <li>Loading OAuth2 providers...</li>
       </ul>
       <script type="module">
           import PocketBase from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pocketbase/js-sdk@master/dist/pocketbase.es.mjs"
           const pb          = new PocketBase("http://127.0.0.1:8090");
           const redirectURL = "http://127.0.0.1:8090/redirect.html";
           const authMethods = await pb.collection("users").listAuthMethods();
           const providers   = authMethods.oauth2?.providers || [];
           const listItems   = [];
           for (const provider of providers) {
               const $li = $(`<li><a>Login with ${provider.name}</a></li>`);
               $li.find("a")
                   .attr("href", provider.authURL + redirectURL)
                   .data("provider", provider)
                   .click(function () {
                       // store provider's data on click for verification in the redirect page
                       localStorage.setItem("provider", JSON.stringify($(this).data("provider")));
                   });
               listItems.push($li);
           }
           $("#list").html(listItems.length ? listItems : "<li>No OAuth2 providers.</li>");
       </script>
</body>
</html>``

2. **Redirect handler page**
    (e.g. https://127.0.0.1:8090/redirect.html serving
    `pb_public/redirect.html`):

`<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
       <meta charset="utf-8">
       <title>OAuth2 redirect page</title>
</head>
<body>
       <pre id="content">Authenticating...</pre>
       <script type="module">
           import PocketBase from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pocketbase/js-sdk@master/dist/pocketbase.es.mjs"
           const pb          = new PocketBase("http://127.0.0.1:8090");
           const redirectURL = "http://127.0.0.1:8090/redirect.html";
           const contentEl   = document.getElementById("content");
           // parse the query parameters from the redirected url
           const params = (new URL(window.location)).searchParams;
           // load the previously stored provider's data
           const provider = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("provider"))
           // compare the redirect's state param and the stored provider's one
           if (provider.state !== params.get("state")) {
               contentEl.innerText = "State parameters don't match.";
           } else {
               // authenticate
               pb.collection("users").authWithOAuth2Code(
                   provider.name,
                   params.get("code"),
                   provider.codeVerifier,
                   redirectURL,
                   // pass any optional user create data
                   {
                       emailVisibility: false,
                   }
               ).then((authData) => {
                   contentEl.innerText = JSON.stringify(authData, null, 2);
               }).catch((err) => {
                   contentEl.innerText = "Failed to exchange code.\n" + err;
               });
           }
       </script>
</body>
</html>`


When using the "Manual code exchange" flow for sign-in with Apple your redirect
handler must accept `POST` requests in order to receive the name and the
email of the Apple user. If you just need the Apple user id, you can keep the redirect
handler `GET` but you'll need to replace in the Apple authorization url
`response_mode=form_post` with `response_mode=query`.

### [Multi-factor authentication](https://pocketbase.io/docs/authentication/\#multi-factor-authentication)

PocketBase v0.23+ introduced optional Multi-factor authentication (MFA).

If enabled, it requires the user to authenticate with any 2 different auth methods from above (the
order doesn't matter).


The expected flow is:

1. User authenticates with "Auth method A".
2. On success, a 401 response is sent with `{"mfaId": "..."}` as JSON body (the MFA
    "session" is stored in the `_mfas` system collection).
3. User authenticates with "Auth method B" as usual
    **but adds the `mfaId` from the previous step as body or query parameter**.
4. On success, a regular auth response is returned, aka. token + auth record data.

Below is an example for email/password + OTP authentication:

JavaScript

Dart

`import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';
const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
...
try {
await pb.collection('users').authWithPassword('test@example.com', '1234567890');
} catch (err) {
const mfaId = err.response?.mfaId;
if (!mfaId) {
    throw err; // not mfa -> rethrow
}
// the user needs to authenticate again with another auth method, for example OTP
const result = await pb.collection('users').requestOTP('test@example.com');
// ... show a modal for users to check their email and to enter the received code ...
await pb.collection('users').authWithOTP(result.otpId, 'EMAIL_CODE', { 'mfaId': mfaId });
}`

`import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart';
final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
...
try {
await pb.collection('users').authWithPassword('test@example.com', '1234567890');
} on ClientException catch (e) {
final mfaId = e.response['mfaId'];
if (mfaId == null) {
    throw e; // not mfa -> rethrow
}
// the user needs to authenticate again with another auth method, for example OTP
final result = await pb.collection('users').requestOTP('test@example.com');
// ... show a modal for users to check their email and to enter the received code ...
await pb.collection('users').authWithOTP(result.otpId, 'EMAIL_CODE', query: { 'mfaId': mfaId });
}`

### [Users impersonation](https://pocketbase.io/docs/authentication/\#users-impersonation)

Superusers have the option to generate tokens and authenticate as anyone else via the
[Impersonate endpoint](https://pocketbase.io/docs/api-records#impersonate)
.

The generated impersonate auth tokens can have custom duration but are not refreshable!

For convenience the official SDKs creates and returns a standalone client that keeps the token state
in memory, aka. only for the duration of the impersonate client instance.

JavaScript

Dart

`import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';
const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
...
// authenticate as superuser
await pb.collection("_superusers").authWithPassword("test@example.com", "1234567890");
// impersonate
// (the custom token duration is in seconds and it is optional)
const impersonateClient = await pb.collection("users").impersonate("USER_RECORD_ID", 3600)
// log the impersonate token and user data
console.log(impersonateClient.authStore.token);
console.log(impersonateClient.authStore.record);
// send requests as the impersonated user
const items = await impersonateClient.collection("example").getFullList();`

`import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart';
final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
...
// authenticate as superuser
await pb.collection("_superusers").authWithPassword("test@example.com", "1234567890");
// impersonate
// (the custom token duration is in seconds and it is optional)
final impersonateClient = await pb.collection("users").impersonate("USER_RECORD_ID", 3600)
// log the impersonate token and user data
print(impersonateClient.authStore.token);
print(impersonateClient.authStore.record);
// send requests as the impersonated user
final items = await impersonateClient.collection("example").getFullList();`

### [API keys](https://pocketbase.io/docs/authentication/\#api-keys)

While PocketBase doesn't have "API keys" in the traditional sense, as a side effect of the support for
users impersonation, for such cases you can use instead the generated non-refreshable
`_superusers` impersonate auth token.


You can generate such token via the above impersonate API or from the
_Dashboard > Collections > \_superusers > {select superuser} > "Impersonate" dropdown option_:

![Screenshot of the _superusers impersonate popup](https://pocketbase.io/images/screenshots/impersonate.png)

Because of the security implications (superusers can execute, access and modify anything), use the
generated `_superusers` tokens with extreme care and only for internal
**server-to-server** communication.

To invalidate already issued tokens, you need to change the individual superuser account password
(or if you want to reset the tokens for all superusers - change the shared auth token secret from
the `_superusers` collection options).

### [Auth token verification](https://pocketbase.io/docs/authentication/\#auth-token-verification)

PocketBase doesn't have a dedicated token verification endpoint, but if you want to verify an existing
auth token from a 3rd party app you can send an
[Auth refresh](https://pocketbase.io/docs/api-records/#auth-refresh)
call, aka. `pb.collection("users").authRefresh()`.

On valid token - it returns a new token with refreshed `exp` claim and the latest user data.

Otherwise - returns an error response.

Note that calling `authRefresh` doesn't invalidate previously issued tokens and you can safely disregard
the new one if you don't need it (as mentioned in the beginning - PocketBase doesn't store the tokens on the
server).

Performance wise, the used `HS256` algorithm for generating the JWT has very little to no
impact and it is essentially the same in terms of response time as calling
`getOne("USER_ID")` _(see_
_[benchmarks](https://github.com/pocketbase/benchmarks/blob/master/results/hetzner_cax11.md#user-auth-refresh))_.

## PocketBase Collections
Collections

- [Overview](https://pocketbase.io/docs/collections/#overview)
  - [Base collection](https://pocketbase.io/docs/collections/#base-collection)
  - [View collection](https://pocketbase.io/docs/collections/#view-collection)
  - [Auth collection](https://pocketbase.io/docs/collections/#auth-collection)
- [Fields](https://pocketbase.io/docs/collections/#fields)

### [Overview](https://pocketbase.io/docs/collections/\#overview)

**Collections** represent your application data. Under the hood they are backed by plain
SQLite tables that are generated automatically with the collection
**name** and **fields** (columns).

Single entry of a collection is called **record** (a single row in the SQL table).

You can manage your **collections** from the Dashboard, with the Web APIs using the
[client-side SDKs](https://pocketbase.io/docs/how-to-use/)
( _superusers only_) or programmatically via the
[Go](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-migrations/)/ [JavaScript](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-migrations/)
migrations.

Similarly, you can manage your **records** from the Dashboard, with the Web APIs using the
[client-side SDKs](https://pocketbase.io/docs/how-to-use/)
or programmatically via the
[Go](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-records/)/ [JavaScript](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-records/)
Record operations.

Here is what a collection edit panel looks like in the Dashboard:

![Collection panel screenshot](https://pocketbase.io/images/screenshots/collection-panel.png)

Currently there are 3 collection types: **Base**, **View** and
**Auth**.

##### [Base collection](https://pocketbase.io/docs/collections/\#base-collection)

**Base collection** is the default collection type and it could be used to store any application
data (articles, products, posts, etc.).

##### [View collection](https://pocketbase.io/docs/collections/\#view-collection)

**View collection** is a read-only collection type where the data is populated from a plain
SQL `SELECT` statement, allowing users to perform aggregations or any other custom queries in
general.


For example, the following query will create a read-only collection with 3 _posts_
fields - _id_, _name_ and _totalComments_:

`SELECT
    posts.id,
    posts.name,
    count(comments.id) as totalComments
FROM posts
LEFT JOIN comments on comments.postId = posts.id
GROUP BY posts.id`

View collections don't receive realtime events because they don't have create/update/delete
operations.

##### [Auth collection](https://pocketbase.io/docs/collections/\#auth-collection)

**Auth collection** has everything from the **Base collection** but with some additional
special fields to help you manage your app users and also providing various authentication options.

Each Auth collection has the following special system fields:
`email`, `emailVisibility`, `verified`,
`password` and `tokenKey`.


They cannot be renamed or deleted but can be configured using their specific field options. For example you
can make the user email required or optional.

You can have as many Auth collections as you want (users, managers, staffs, members, clients, etc.) each
with their own set of fields, separate login and records managing endpoints.

You can build all sort of different access controls:

- **Role (Group)**

_For example, you could attach a "role" `select` field to your Auth collection with the_
_following options: "employee" and "staff". And then in some of your other collections you could_
_define the following rule to allow only "staff":_


_`@request.auth.role = "staff"`_
- **Relation (Ownership)**

_Let's say that you have 2 collections - "posts" base collection and "users" auth collection. In_
_your "posts" collection you can create "author"_
_`relation` field pointing to the "users" collection. To allow access to only the_
_"author" of the record(s), you could use a rule like:_
_`@request.auth.id != "" && author = @request.auth.id`_


_Nested relation fields look ups, including back-relations, are also supported, for example:_
_`someRelField.anotherRelField.author = @request.auth.id`_
- **Managed**

_In addition to the default "List", "View", "Create", "Update", "Delete" API rules, Auth_
_collections have also a special "Manage" API rule that could be used to allow one user (it could_
_be even from a different collection) to be able to fully manage the data of another user (e.g._
_changing their email, password, etc.)._
- **Mixed**

_You can build a mixed approach based on your unique use-case. Multiple rules can be grouped with_
_parenthesis `()` and combined with `&&`_
_(AND) and `||` (OR) operators:_


_`@request.auth.id != "" && (@request.auth.role = "staff" || author = @request.auth.id)`_

### [Fields](https://pocketbase.io/docs/collections/\#fields)

All collection fields _(with exception of the `JSONField`)_ are
**non-nullable and uses a zero-default** for their respective type as fallback value
when missing (empty string for `text`, 0 for `number`, etc.).

All field specific modifiers are supported both in the Web APIs and via the record Get/Set
methods.

**[BoolField](https://pocketbase.io/docs/collections/#boolfield)**

BoolField defines `bool` type field to store a single `false`
(default) or `true` value.

**[NumberField](https://pocketbase.io/docs/collections/#numberfield)**

NumberField defines `number` type field for storing numeric/float64 value:
`0` (default), `2`, `-1`, `1.5`.

The following additional set modifiers are available:

- `fieldName+`
adds number to the already existing record value.
- `fieldName-`
subtracts number from the already existing record value.

**[TextField](https://pocketbase.io/docs/collections/#textfield)**

TextField defines `text` type field for storing string values:
`""` (default), `"example"`.

The following additional set modifiers are available:

- `fieldName:autogenerate`
autogenerate a field value if the `AutogeneratePattern` field option is set.



For example, submitting:
`{"slug:autogenerate":"abc-"}` will result in `"abc-[random]"` `slug` field value.

**[EmailField](https://pocketbase.io/docs/collections/#emailfield)**

EmailField defines `email` type field for storing a single email string address:
`""` (default), `"john@example.com"`.

**[URLField](https://pocketbase.io/docs/collections/#urlfield)**

URLField defines `url` type field for storing a single URL string value:
`""` (default), `"https://example.com"`.

**[EditorField](https://pocketbase.io/docs/collections/#editorfield)**

EditorField defines `editor` type field to store HTML formatted text:
`""` (default), `<p>example</p>`.

**[DateField](https://pocketbase.io/docs/collections/#datefield)**

DateField defines `date` type field to store a single datetime string value:
`""` (default), `"2022-01-01 00:00:00.000Z"`.

All PocketBase dates at the moment follows the RFC3399 format `Y-m-d H:i:s.uZ`
(e.g. `2024-11-10 18:45:27.123Z`).

Dates are compared as strings, meaning that when using the filters with a date field you'll
have to specify the full datetime string format. For example to target a single day (e.g.
November 19, 2024) you can use something like:
`created >= '2024-11-19 00:00:00.000Z' && created <= '2024-11-19 23:59:59.999Z'`

**[AutodateField](https://pocketbase.io/docs/collections/#autodatefield)**

AutodateField defines an `autodate` type field and it is similar to the DateField but
its value is auto set on record create/update.

This field is usually used for defining timestamp fields like "created" and "updated".

**[SelectField](https://pocketbase.io/docs/collections/#selectfield)**

SelectField defines `select` type field for storing single or multiple string values
from a predefined list.

It is usually intended for handling enums-like values such as
`pending/public/private`
statuses, simple `client/staff/manager/admin` roles, etc.

For **single** `select` _(the `MaxSelect` option is <= 1)_
the field value is a string:
`""`, `"optionA"`.

For **multiple** `select` _(the `MaxSelect` option is >= 2)_
the field value is an array:
`[]`, `["optionA", "optionB"]`.

The following additional set modifiers are available:

- `fieldName+`
appends one or more values to the existing one.
- `+fieldName`
prepends one or more values to the existing one.
- `fieldName-`
subtracts/removes one or more values from the existing one.

For example: `{"permissions+": "optionA", "roles-": ["staff", "editor"]}`

**[FileField](https://pocketbase.io/docs/collections/#filefield)**

FileField defines `file` type field for managing record file(s).

PocketBase stores in the database only the file name. The file itself is stored either on the
local disk or in S3, depending on your application storage settings.

For **single** `file` _(the `MaxSelect` option is <= 1)_
the stored value is a string:
`""`, `"file1_Ab24ZjL.png"`.

For **multiple** `file` _(the `MaxSelect` option is >= 2)_
the stored value is an array:
`[]`, `["file1_Ab24ZjL.png", "file2_Frq24ZjL.txt"]`.

The following additional set modifiers are available:

- `fieldName+`
appends one or more files to the existing field value.
- `+fieldName`
prepends one or more files to the existing field value.
- `fieldName-`
deletes one or more files from the existing field value.

For example:
`{"documents+": new File(...), "documents-": ["file1_Ab24ZjL.txt", "file2_Frq24ZjL.txt"]}`

You can find more detailed information in the
[Files upload and handling](https://pocketbase.io/docs/files-handling/) guide.

**[RelationField](https://pocketbase.io/docs/collections/#relationfield)**

RelationField defines `relation` type field for storing single or multiple collection
record references.

For **single** `relation` _(the `MaxSelect` option is <= 1)_
the field value is a string:
`""`, `"RECOD_ID"`.

For **multiple** `relation` _(the `MaxSelect` option is >= 2)_
the field value is an array:
`[]`, `["RECORD_ID1", "RECORD_ID2"]`.

The following additional set modifiers are available:

- `fieldName+`
appends one or more ids to the existing one.
- `+fieldName`
prepends one or more ids to the existing one.
- `fieldName-`
subtracts/removes one or more ids from the existing one.

For example: `{"users+": "USER_ID", "categories-": ["CAT_ID1", "CAT_ID2"]}`

**[JSONField](https://pocketbase.io/docs/collections/#jsonfield)**

JSONField defines `json` type field for storing any serialized JSON value,
including `null` (default).

## PocketBase Go Routing
Routing

PocketBase routing is built on top of the standard Go
[`net/http.ServeMux`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#ServeMux).
The router can be accessed via the `app.OnServe()` hook allowing you to register custom endpoints
and middlewares.

### [Routes](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-routing/\#routes)

##### [Registering new routes](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-routing/\#registering-new-routes)

Every route have a path, handler function and eventually middlewares attached to it. For example:

`app.OnServe().BindFunc(func(se *core.ServeEvent) error {
    // register "GET /hello/{name}" route (allowed for everyone)
    se.Router.GET("/hello/{name}", func(e *core.RequestEvent) error {
        name := e.Request.PathValue("name")
        return e.String(http.StatusOK, "Hello " + name)
    })
    // register "POST /api/myapp/settings" route (allowed only for authenticated users)
    se.Router.POST("/api/myapp/settings", func(e *core.RequestEvent) error {
        // do something ...
        return e.JSON(http.StatusOK, map[string]bool{"success": true})
    }).Bind(apis.RequireAuth())
    return se.Next()
})`

There are several routes registration methods available, but the most common ones are:

`se.Router.GET(path, action)
se.Router.POST(path, action)
se.Router.PUT(path, action)
se.Router.PATCH(path, action)
se.Router.DELETE(path, action)
// If you want to handle any HTTP method define only a path (e.g. "/example")
// OR if you want to specify a custom one add it as prefix to the path (e.g. "TRACE /example")
se.Router.Any(pattern, action)`

The router also supports creating groups for routes that share the same base path and middlewares. For
example:

`g := se.Router.Group("/api/myapp")
// group middleware
g.Bind(apis.RequireAuth())
// group routes
g.GET("", action1)
g.GET("/example/{id}", action2)
g.PATCH("/example/{id}", action3).BindFunc(
    /* custom route specific middleware func */
)
// nested group
sub := g.Group("/sub")
sub.GET("/sub1", action4)`

The example registers the following endpoints


(all require authenticated user access):

- GET /api/myapp -> action1
- GET /api/myapp/example/{id} -> action2
- PATCH /api/myapp/example/{id} -> action3
- GET /api/myapp/example/sub/sub1 -> action4

Each router group and route could define [middlewares](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-routing/#middlewares) in a similar manner to the
regular app hooks via the `Bind/BindFunc` methods, allowing you to perform various BEFORE or AFTER
action operations (e.g. inspecting request headers, custom access checks, etc.).

##### [Path parameters and matching rules](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-routing/\#path-parameters-and-matching-rules)

Because PocketBase routing is based on top of the Go standard router mux, we follow the same pattern
matching rules. Below you could find a short overview but for more details please refer to
[`net/http.ServeMux`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#ServeMux).

In general, a route pattern looks like `[METHOD ][HOST]/[PATH]`
( _the METHOD prefix is added automatically when using the designated `GET()`,_
_`POST()`, etc. methods)_).

Route paths can include parameters in the format `{paramName}`.


You can also use `{paramName...}` format to specify a parameter that target more than one path
segment.

A pattern ending with a trailing slash `/` acts as anonymous wildcard and matches any requests
that begins with the defined route. If you want to have a trailing slash but to indicate the end of the
URL then you need to end the path with the special
`{$}` parameter.

If your route path starts with `/api/`
consider combining it with your unique app name like `/api/myapp/...` to avoid collisions
with system routes.

Here are some examples:

`// match "GET example.com/index.html"
se.Router.GET("example.com/index.html")
// match "GET /index.html" (for any host)
se.Router.GET("/index.html")
// match "GET /static/", "GET /static/a/b/c", etc.
se.Router.GET("/static/")
// match "GET /static/", "GET /static/a/b/c", etc.
// (similar to the above but with a named wildcard parameter)
se.Router.GET("/static/{path...}")
// match only "GET /static/" (if no "/static" is registered, it is 301 redirected)
se.Router.GET("/static/{$}")
// match "GET /customers/john", "GET /customer/jane", etc.
se.Router.GET("/customers/{name}")`

* * *

In the following examples `e` is usually
[`*core.RequestEvent`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core#RequestEvent) value.

* * *

##### [Reading path parameters](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-routing/\#reading-path-parameters)

`id := e.Request.PathValue("id")`

##### [Retrieving the current auth state](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-routing/\#retrieving-the-current-auth-state)

The request auth state can be accessed (or set) via the `RequestEvent.Auth` field.

`authRecord := e.Auth
isGuest := e.Auth == nil
// the same as "e.Auth != nil && e.Auth.IsSuperuser()"
isSuperuser := e.HasSuperuserAuth()`

Alternatively you could also access the request data from the summarized request info instance
_(usually used in hooks like the `OnRecordEnrich` where there is no direct access to the request)_.

`info, err := e.RequestInfo()
authRecord := info.Auth
isGuest := info.Auth == nil
// the same as "info.Auth != nil && info.Auth.IsSuperuser()"
isSuperuser := info.HasSuperuserAuth()`

##### [Reading query parameters](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-routing/\#reading-query-parameters)

`search := e.Request.URL.Query().Get("search")
// or via the parsed request info
info, err := e.RequestInfo()
search := info.Query["search"]`

##### [Reading request headers](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-routing/\#reading-request-headers)

`token := e.Request.Header.Get("Some-Header")
// or via the parsed request info
// (the header value is always normalized per the @request.headers.* API rules format)
info, err := e.RequestInfo()
token := info.Headers["some_header"]`

##### [Writing response headers](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-routing/\#writing-response-headers)

`e.Response.Header().Set("Some-Header", "123")`

##### [Retrieving uploaded files](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-routing/\#retrieving-uploaded-files)

`// retrieve the uploaded files and parse the found multipart data into a ready-to-use []*filesystem.File
files, err := e.FindUploadedFiles("document")
// or retrieve the raw single multipart/form-data file and header
mf, mh, err := e.Request.FormFile("document")`

##### [Reading request body](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-routing/\#reading-request-body)

Body parameters can be read either via
[`e.BindBody`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/router#Event.BindBody)
OR through the parsed request info ( _requires manual type assertions_).

The `e.BindBody` argument must be a pointer to a struct or `map[string]any`.


The following struct tags are supported
_(the specific binding rules and which one will be used depend on the request Content-Type)_:

- `json` (json body)- uses the builtin Go JSON package for unmarshaling.
- `xml` (xml body) - uses the builtin Go XML package for unmarshaling.
- `form` (form data) - utilizes the custom
[`router.UnmarshalRequestData`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/router#UnmarshalRequestData)
method.

NB! When binding structs make sure that they don't have public fields that shouldn't be bindable and it is
advisable such fields to be unexported or define a separate struct with just the safe bindable fields.

``// read/scan the request body fields into a typed struct
data := struct {
    // unexported to prevent binding
    somethingPrivate string
    Title       string `json:"title" form:"title"`
    Description string `json:"description" form:"description"`
    Active      bool   `json:"active" form:"active"`
}{}
if err := e.BindBody(&data); err != nil {
    return e.BadRequestError("Failed to read request data", err)
}
// alternatively, read the body via the parsed request info
info, err := e.RequestInfo()
title, ok := info.Body["title"].(string)``

##### [Writing response body](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-routing/\#writing-response-body)

_For all supported methods, you can refer to_
_[`router.Event`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/router#Event)_
_._

`// send response with JSON body
// (it also provides a generic response fields picker/filter if the "fields" query parameter is set)
e.JSON(http.StatusOK, map[string]any{"name": "John"})
// send response with string body
e.String(http.StatusOK, "Lorem ipsum...")
// send response with HTML body
// (check also the "Rendering templates" section)
e.HTML(http.StatusOK, "<h1>Hello!</h1>")
// redirect
e.Redirect(http.StatusTemporaryRedirect, "https://example.com")
// send response with no body
e.NoContent(http.StatusNoContent)
// serve a single file
e.FileFS(os.DirFS("..."), "example.txt")
// stream the specified reader
e.Stream(http.StatusOK, "application/octet-stream", reader)
// send response with blob (bytes slice) body
e.Blob(http.StatusOK, "application/octet-stream", []byte{ ... })`

##### [Reading the client IP](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-routing/\#reading-the-client-ip)

`// The IP of the last client connecting to your server.
// The returned IP is safe and can be always trusted.
// When behind a reverse proxy (e.g. nginx) this method returns the IP of the proxy.
// https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/router#Event.RemoteIP
ip := e.RemoteIP()
// The "real" IP of the client based on the configured Settings.TrustedProxy header(s).
// If such headers are not set, it fallbacks to e.RemoteIP().
// https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core#RequestEvent.RealIP
ip := e.RealIP()`

##### [Request store](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-routing/\#request-store)

The `core.RequestEvent` comes with a local store that you can use to share custom data between
[middlewares](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-routing/#middlewares) and the route action.

`// store for the duration of the request
e.Set("someKey", 123)
// retrieve later
val := e.Get("someKey").(int) // 123`

### [Middlewares](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-routing/\#middlewares)

##### [Registering middlewares](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-routing/\#registering-middlewares)

Middlewares allow inspecting, intercepting and filtering route requests.

All middleware functions share the same signature with the route actions (aka.
`func(e *core.RequestEvent) error`) but expect the user to call `e.Next()` if they
want to proceed with the execution chain.

Middlewares can be registered _globally_, on _group_ and on _route_ level using the
`Bind`
and `BindFunc` methods.

Here is a minimal example of a what global middleware looks like:

`app.OnServe().BindFunc(func(se *core.ServeEvent) error {
    // register a global middleware
    se.Router.BindFunc(func(e *core.RequestEvent) error {
        if e.Request.Header.Get("Something") == "" {
            return e.BadRequestError("Something header value is missing!", nil)
        }
        return e.Next()
    })
    return se.Next()
})`

[`RouterGroup.Bind(middlewares...)`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/router#RouterGroup.Bind)
/
[`Route.Bind(middlewares...)`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/router#Route.Bind)
registers one or more middleware handlers.


Similar to the other app hooks, a middleware handler has 3 fields:

- `Id` _(optional)_ \- the name of the middleware (could be used as argument for
`Unbind`)
- `Priority` _(optional)_ \- the execution order of the middleware (if empty fallbacks to
the order of registration in the code)
- `Func` _(required)_ \- the middleware handler function

Often you don't need to specify the `Id` or `Priority` of the middleware and for
convenience you can instead use directly
[`RouterGroup.BindFunc(funcs...)`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/router#RouterGroup.BindFunc)
/
[`Route.BindFunc(funcs...)`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/router#Route.BindFunc) .

Below is a slightly more advanced example showing all options and the execution sequence ( _2,0,1,3,4_):

`app.OnServe().BindFunc(func(se *core.ServeEvent) error {
    // attach global middleware
    se.Router.BindFunc(func(e *core.RequestEvent) error {
        println(0)
        return e.Next()
    })
    g := se.Router.Group("/sub")
    // attach group middleware
    g.BindFunc(func(e *core.RequestEvent) error {
        println(1)
        return e.Next()
    })
    // attach group middleware with an id and custom priority
    g.Bind(&hook.Handler[*core.RequestEvent]{
        Id: "something",
        Func: func(e *core.RequestEvent) error {
            println(2)
            return e.Next()
        },
        Priority: -1,
    })
    // attach middleware to a single route
    //
    // "GET /sub/hello" should print the sequence: 2,0,1,3,4
    g.GET("/hello", func(e *core.RequestEvent) error {
        println(4)
        return e.String(200, "Hello!")
    }).BindFunc(func(e *core.RequestEvent) error {
        println(3)
        return e.Next()
    })
    return se.Next()
})`

##### [Removing middlewares](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-routing/\#removing-middlewares)

To remove a registered middleware from the execution chain for a specific group or route you can make use
of the
`Unbind(id)` method.

Note that only middlewares that have a non-empty `Id` can be removed.

`app.OnServe().BindFunc(func(se *core.ServeEvent) error {
    // global middleware
    se.Router.Bind(&hook.Handler[*core.RequestEvent]{
        Id: "test",
        Func: func(e *core.RequestEvent) error {
            // ...
            return e.Next()
        },
    )
    // "GET /A" invokes the "test" middleware
    se.Router.GET("/A", func(e *core.RequestEvent) error {
        return e.String(200, "A")
    })
    // "GET /B" doesn't invoke the "test" middleware
    se.Router.GET("/B", func(e *core.RequestEvent) error {
        return e.String(200, "B")
    }).Unbind("test")
    return se.Next()
})`

##### [Builtin middlewares](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-routing/\#builtin-middlewares)

The
[`apis`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/apis)
package exposes several middlewares that you can use as part of your application.

`// Require the request client to be unauthenticated (aka. guest).
// Example: Route.Bind(apis.RequireGuestOnly())
apis.RequireGuestOnly()
// Require the request client to be authenticated
// (optionally specify a list of allowed auth collection names, default to any).
// Example: Route.Bind(apis.RequireAuth())
apis.RequireAuth(optCollectionNames...)
// Require the request client to be authenticated as superuser
// (this is an alias for apis.RequireAuth(core.CollectionNameSuperusers)).
// Example: Route.Bind(apis.RequireSuperuserAuth())
apis.RequireSuperuserAuth()
// Require the request client to be authenticated as superuser OR
// regular auth record with id matching the specified route parameter (default to "id").
// Example: Route.Bind(apis.RequireSuperuserOrOwnerAuth(""))
apis.RequireSuperuserOrOwnerAuth(ownerIdParam)
// Changes the global 32MB default request body size limit (set it to 0 for no limit).
// Note that system record routes have dynamic body size limit based on their collection field types.
// Example: Route.Bind(apis.BodyLimit(10 << 20))
apis.BodyLimit(limitBytes)
// Compresses the HTTP response using Gzip compression scheme.
// Example: Route.Bind(apis.Gzip())
apis.Gzip()
// Instructs the activity logger to log only requests that have failed/returned an error.
// Example: Route.Bind(apis.SkipSuccessActivityLog())
apis.SkipSuccessActivityLog()`

##### [Default globally registered middlewares](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-routing/\#default-globally-registered-middlewares)

The below list is mostly useful for users that may want to plug their own custom middlewares before/after
the priority of the default global ones, for example: registering a custom auth loader before the rate
limiter with `apis.DefaultRateLimitMiddlewarePriority - 1` so that the rate limit can be applied
properly based on the loaded auth state.

All PocketBase applications have the below internal middlewares registered out of the box ( _sorted by their priority_):


- **WWW redirect** [`apis.DefaultWWWRedirectMiddlewareId`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/apis#pkg-constants) [`apis.DefaultWWWRedirectMiddlewarePriority`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/apis#pkg-constants)

_Performs www -> non-www redirect(s) if the request host matches with one of the values in_
_certificate host policy._
- **CORS** [`apis.DefaultCorsMiddlewareId`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/apis#pkg-constants) [`apis.DefaultCorsMiddlewarePriority`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/apis#pkg-constants)

_By default all origins are allowed (PocketBase is stateless and doesn't rely on cookies) and can_
_be configured with the `--origins`_
_flag but for more advanced customization it can be also replaced entirely by binding with_
_`apis.CORS(config)` middleware or registering your own custom one in its place._
- **Activity logger** [`apis.DefaultActivityLoggerMiddlewareId`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/apis#pkg-constants) [`apis.DefaultActivityLoggerMiddlewarePriority`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/apis#pkg-constants)

_Saves request information into the logs auxiliary database._
- **Auto panic recover** [`apis.DefaultPanicRecoverMiddlewareId`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/apis#pkg-constants) [`apis.DefaultPanicRecoverMiddlewarePriority`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/apis#pkg-constants)

_Default panic-recover handler._
- **Auth token loader** [`apis.DefaultLoadAuthTokenMiddlewareId`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/apis#pkg-constants) [`apis.DefaultLoadAuthTokenMiddlewarePriority`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/apis#pkg-constants)

_Loads the auth token from the `Authorization` header and populates the related auth_
_record into the request event (aka. `e.Auth`)._
- **Security response headers** [`apis.DefaultSecurityHeadersMiddlewareId`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/apis#pkg-constants) [`apis.DefaultSecurityHeadersMiddlewarePriority`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/apis#pkg-constants)

_Adds default common security headers ( `X-XSS-Protection`,_
_`X-Content-Type-Options`,_
_`X-Frame-Options`) to the response (can be overwritten by other middlewares or from_
_inside the route action)._
- **Rate limit** [`apis.DefaultRateLimitMiddlewareId`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/apis#pkg-constants) [`apis.DefaultRateLimitMiddlewarePriority`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/apis#pkg-constants)

_Rate limits client requests based on the configured app settings (it does nothing if the rate_
_limit option is not enabled)._
- **Body limit** [`apis.DefaultBodyLimitMiddlewareId`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/apis#pkg-constants) [`apis.DefaultBodyLimitMiddlewarePriority`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/apis#pkg-constants)

_Applies a default max ~32MB request body limit for all custom routes ( system record routes have_
_dynamic body size limit based on their collection field types). Can be overwritten on group/route_
_level by simply rebinding the `apis.BodyLimit(limitBytes)` middleware._

### [Error response](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-routing/\#error-response)

PocketBase has a global error handler and every returned error from a route or middleware will be safely
converted by default to a generic `ApiError` to avoid accidentally leaking sensitive
information (the original raw error message will be visible only in the _Dashboard > Logs_ or when
in `--dev` mode).

To make it easier returning formatted JSON error responses, the request event provides several
`ApiError` methods.


Note that `ApiError.RawData()` will be returned in the response only if it is a map of
`router.SafeErrorItem`/ `validation.Error` items.

`import validation "github.com/go-ozzo/ozzo-validation/v4"
se.Router.GET("/example", func(e *core.RequestEvent) error {
    ...
    // construct ApiError with custom status code and validation data error
    return e.Error(500, "something went wrong", map[string]validation.Error{
        "title": validation.NewError("invalid_title", "Invalid or missing title"),
    })
    // if message is empty string, a default one will be set
    return e.BadRequestError(optMessage, optData)      // 400 ApiError
    return e.UnauthorizedError(optMessage, optData)    // 401 ApiError
    return e.ForbiddenError(optMessage, optData)       // 403 ApiError
    return e.NotFoundError(optMessage, optData)        // 404 ApiError
    return e.TooManyRequestsError(optMessage, optData) // 429 ApiError
    return e.InternalServerError(optMessage, optData)  // 500 ApiError
})`

This is not very common but if you want to return `ApiError` outside of request related
handlers, you can use the below
`apis.*` factories:

`import (
    validation "github.com/go-ozzo/ozzo-validation/v4"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/apis"
)
app.OnRecordCreate().BindFunc(func(e *core.RecordEvent) error {
    ...
    // construct ApiError with custom status code and validation data error
    return apis.NewApiError(500, "something went wrong", map[string]validation.Error{
        "title": validation.NewError("invalid_title", "Invalid or missing title"),
    })
    // if message is empty string, a default one will be set
    return apis.NewBadRequestError(optMessage, optData)      // 400 ApiError
    return apis.NewUnauthorizedError(optMessage, optData)    // 401 ApiError
    return apis.NewForbiddenError(optMessage, optData)       // 403 ApiError
    return apis.NewNotFoundError(optMessage, optData)        // 404 ApiError
    return apis.NewTooManyRequestsError(optMessage, optData) // 429 ApiError
    return apis.NewInternalServerError(optMessage, optData)  // 500 ApiError
})`

### [Helpers](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-routing/\#helpers)

##### [Serving static directory](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-routing/\#serving-static-directory)

[`apis.Static()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/apis#Static)
serves static directory content from `fs.FS` instance.

Expects the route to have a `{path...}` wildcard parameter.

`app.OnServe().BindFunc(func(se *core.ServeEvent) error {
    // serves static files from the provided dir (if exists)
    se.Router.GET("/{path...}", apis.Static(os.DirFS("/path/to/public"), false))
    return se.Next()
})`

##### [Auth response](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-routing/\#auth-response)

[`apis.RecordAuthResponse()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/apis#RecordAuthResponse)

writes standardized JSON record auth response (aka. token + record data) into the specified request body.
Could be used as a return result from a custom auth route.

``app.OnServe().BindFunc(func(se *core.ServeEvent) error {
    se.Router.POST("/phone-login", func(e *core.RequestEvent) error {
        data := struct {
            Phone    string `json:"phone" form:"phone"`
            Password string `json:"password" form:"password"`
        }{}
        if err := e.BindBody(&data); err != nil {
            return e.BadRequestError("Failed to read request data", err)
        }
        record, err := e.App.FindFirstRecordByData("users", "phone", data.Phone)
        if err != nil || !record.ValidatePassword(data.Password) {
            // return generic 400 error as a basic enumeration protection
            return e.BadRequestError("Invalid credentials", err)
        }
        return apis.RecordAuthResponse(e, record, "phone", nil)
    })
    return se.Next()
})``

##### [Enrich record(s)](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-routing/\#enrich-records)

[`apis.EnrichRecord()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/apis#EnrichRecord)
and
[`apis.EnrichRecords()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/apis#EnrichRecords)
helpers parses the request context and enrich the provided record(s) by:

- expands relations (if `defaultExpands` and/or `?expand` query parameter is set)
- ensures that the emails of the auth record and its expanded auth relations are visible only for the
current logged superuser, record owner or record with manage access

`app.OnServe().BindFunc(func(se *core.ServeEvent) error {
    se.Router.GET("/custom-article", func(e *core.RequestEvent) error {
        records, err := e.App.FindRecordsByFilter("article", "status = 'active'", "-created", 40, 0)
        if err != nil {
            return e.NotFoundError("No active articles", err)
        }
        // enrich the records with the "categories" relation as default expand
        err = apis.EnrichRecords(e, records, "categories")
        if err != nil {
            return err
        }
        return e.JSON(http.StatusOK, records)
    })
    return se.Next()
})`

##### [Go http.Handler wrappers](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-routing/\#go-http-handler-wrappers)

If you want to register standard Go `http.Handler` function and middlewares, you can use
[`apis.WrapStdHandler(handler)`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/apis#WrapStdHandler)
and
[`apis.WrapStdMiddleware(func)`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/apis#WrapStdMiddleware)
functions.

### [Sending request to custom routes using the SDKs](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-routing/\#sending-request-to-custom-routes-using-the-sdks)

The official PocketBase SDKs expose the internal `send()` method that could be used to send requests
to your custom route(s).

JavaScript

Dart

`import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';
const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
await pb.send("/hello", {
    // for other options check
    // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch#options
    query: { "abc": 123 },
});`

`import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart';
final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
await pb.send("/hello", query: { "abc": 123 })`

## PocketBase Record Management
Record operations

The most common task when using PocketBase as framework probably would be querying and working with your
collection records.

You could find detailed documentation about all the supported Record model methods in
[`core.Record`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core#Record)
but below are some examples with the most common ones.

- [Set field value](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-records/#set-field-value)
- [Get field value](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-records/#get-field-value)

- [Programmatically expanding relations](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-records/#programmatically-expanding-relations)
- [Check if record can be accessed](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-records/#check-if-record-can-be-accessed)
- [Generating and validating tokens](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-records/#generating-and-validating-tokens)

### [Set field value](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-records/\#set-field-value)

`// sets the value of a single record field
// (field type specific modifiers are also supported)
record.Set("title", "example")
record.Set("users+", "6jyr1y02438et52") // append to existing value
// populates a record from a data map
// (calls Set for each entry of the map)
record.Load(data)`

### [Get field value](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-records/\#get-field-value)

`// retrieve a single record field value
// (field specific modifiers are also supported)
record.Get("someField")            // -> any (without cast)
record.GetBool("someField")        // -> cast to bool
record.GetString("someField")      // -> cast to string
record.GetInt("someField")         // -> cast to int
record.GetFloat("someField")       // -> cast to float64
record.GetDateTime("someField")    // -> cast to types.DateTime
record.GetStringSlice("someField") // -> cast to []string
// retrieve the new uploaded files
// (e.g. for inspecting and modifying the file(s) before save)
record.GetUnsavedFiles("someFileField")
// unmarshal a single "json" field value into the provided result
record.UnmarshalJSONField("someJSONField", &result)
// retrieve a single or multiple expanded data
record.ExpandedOne("author")     // -> nil|*core.Record
record.ExpandedAll("categories") // -> []*core.Record
// export all the public safe record fields as map[string]any
// (note: "json" type field values are exported as types.JSONRaw bytes slice)
record.PublicExport()`

### [Auth accessors](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-records/\#auth-accessors)

`record.IsSuperuser() // alias for record.Collection().Name == "_superusers"
record.Email()         // alias for record.Get("email")
record.SetEmail(email) // alias for record.Set("email", email)
record.Verified()         // alias for record.Get("verified")
record.SetVerified(false) // alias for record.Set("verified", false)
record.TokenKey()        // alias for record.Get("tokenKey")
record.SetTokenKey(key)  // alias for record.Set("tokenKey", key)
record.RefreshTokenKey() // alias for record.Set("tokenKey:autogenerate", "")
record.ValidatePassword(pass)
record.SetPassword(pass)   // alias for record.Set("password", pass)
record.SetRandomPassword() // sets cryptographically random 30 characters string as password`

### [Copies](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-records/\#copies)

`// returns a shallow copy of the current record model populated
// with its ORIGINAL db data state and everything else reset to the defaults
// (usually used for comparing old and new field values)
record.Original()
// returns a shallow copy of the current record model populated
// with its LATEST data state and everything else reset to the defaults
// (aka. no expand, no custom fields and with default visibility flags)
record.Fresh()
// returns a shallow copy of the current record model populated
// with its ALL collection and custom fields data, expand and visibility flags
record.Clone()`

### [Hide/Unhide fields](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-records/\#hideunhide-fields)

Collection fields can be marked as "Hidden" from the Dashboard to prevent regular user access to the field
values.

Record models provide an option to further control the fields serialization visibility in addition to the
"Hidden" fields option using the
[`record.Hide(fieldNames...)`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core#Record.Hide)
and
[`record.Unhide(fieldNames...)`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core#Record.Unhide)
methods.

Often the `Hide/Unhide` methods are used in combination with the `OnRecordEnrich` hook
invoked on every record enriching (list, view, create, update, realtime change, etc.). For example:

`app.OnRecordEnrich("articles").BindFunc(func(e *core.RecordEnrichEvent) error {
    // dynamically show/hide a record field depending on whether the current
    // authenticated user has a certain "role" (or any other field constraint)
    if e.RequestInfo.Auth == nil ||
        (!e.RequestInfo.Auth.IsSuperuser() && e.RequestInfo.Auth.GetString("role") != "staff") {
        e.Record.Hide("someStaffOnlyField")
    }
    return e.Next()
})`

For custom fields, not part of the record collection schema, it is required to call explicitly
`record.WithCustomData(true)` to allow them in the public serialization.

### [Fetch records](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-records/\#fetch-records)

##### [Fetch single record](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-records/\#fetch-single-record)

All single record retrieval methods return `nil` and `sql.ErrNoRows` error if no record
is found.

`// retrieve a single "articles" record by its id
record, err := app.FindRecordById("articles", "RECORD_ID")
// retrieve a single "articles" record by a single key-value pair
record, err := app.FindFirstRecordByData("articles", "slug", "test")
// retrieve a single "articles" record by a string filter expression
// (NB! use "{:placeholder}" to safely bind untrusted user input parameters)
record, err := app.FindFirstRecordByFilter(
    "articles",
    "status = 'public' && category = {:category}",
    dbx.Params{ "category": "news" },
)`

##### [Fetch multiple records](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-records/\#fetch-multiple-records)

All multiple records retrieval methods return empty slice and `nil` error if no records are found.

`// retrieve multiple "articles" records by their ids
records, err := app.FindRecordsByIds("articles", []string{"RECORD_ID1", "RECORD_ID2"})
// retrieve the total number of "articles" records in a collection with optional dbx expressions
totalPending, err := app.CountRecords("articles", dbx.HashExp{"status": "pending"})
// retrieve multiple "articles" records with optional dbx expressions
records, err := app.FindAllRecords("articles",
    dbx.NewExp("LOWER(username) = {:username}", dbx.Params{"username": "John.Doe"}),
    dbx.HashExp{"status": "pending"},
)
// retrieve multiple paginated "articles" records by a string filter expression
// (NB! use "{:placeholder}" to safely bind untrusted user input parameters)
records, err := app.FindRecordsByFilter(
    "articles",                                    // collection
    "status = 'public' && category = {:category}", // filter
    "-published",                                   // sort
    10,                                            // limit
    0,                                             // offset
    dbx.Params{ "category": "news" },              // optional filter params
)`

##### [Fetch auth records](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-records/\#fetch-auth-records)

`// retrieve a single auth record by its email
user, err := app.FindAuthRecordByEmail("users", "test@example.com")
// retrieve a single auth record by JWT
// (you could also specify an optional list of accepted token types)
user, err := app.FindAuthRecordByToken("YOUR_TOKEN", core.TokenTypeAuth)`

##### [Custom record query](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-records/\#custom-record-query)

In addition to the above query helpers, you can also create custom Record queries using
[`RecordQuery(collection)`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core#RecordQuery)
method. It returns a SELECT DB builder that can be used with the same methods described in the
[Database guide](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-database).

`import (
    "github.com/pocketbase/dbx"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
)
...
func FindActiveArticles(app core.App) ([]*core.Record, error) {
    records := []*core.Record{}
    err := app.RecordQuery("articles").
        AndWhere(dbx.HashExp{"status": "active"}).
        OrderBy("published DESC").
        Limit(10).
        All(&records)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    return records, nil
}`

### [Create new record](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-records/\#create-new-record)

##### [Create new record programmatically](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-records/\#create-new-record-programmatically)

`import (
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/filesystem"
)
...
collection, err := app.FindCollectionByNameOrId("articles")
if err != nil {
    return err
}
record := core.NewRecord(collection)
record.Set("title", "Lorem ipsum")
record.Set("active", true)
// field type specific modifiers can also be used
record.Set("slug:autogenerate", "post-")
// new files must be one or a slice of *filesystem.File values
//
// note1: see all factories in https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/filesystem#File
// note2: for reading files from a request event you can also use e.FindUploadedFiles("fileKey")
f1, _ := filesystem.NewFileFromPath("/local/path/to/file1.txt")
f2, _ := filesystem.NewFileFromBytes([]byte{"test content"}, "file2.txt")
f3, _ := filesystem.NewFileFromURL(context.Background(), "https://example.com/file3.pdf")
record.Set("documents", []*filesystem.File{f1, f2, f3})
// validate and persist
// (use SaveNoValidate to skip fields validation)
err = app.Save(record);
if err != nil {
    return err
}`

##### [Intercept create request](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-records/\#intercept-create-request)

`import (
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
)
...
app.OnRecordCreateRequest("articles").BindFunc(func(e *core.RecordRequestEvent) error {
    // ignore for superusers
    if e.HasSuperuserAuth() {
        return e.Next()
    }
    // overwrite the submitted "status" field value
    e.Record.Set("status", "pending")
    // or you can also prevent the create event by returning an error
    status := e.Record.GetString("status")
    if (status != "pending" &&
        // guest or not an editor
        (e.Auth == nil || e.Auth.GetString("role") != "editor")) {
        return e.BadRequestError("Only editors can set a status different from pending", nil)
    }
    return e.Next()
})`

### [Update existing record](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-records/\#update-existing-record)

##### [Update existing record programmatically](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-records/\#update-existing-record-programmatically)

`record, err := app.FindRecordById("articles", "RECORD_ID")
if err != nil {
    return err
}
record.Set("title", "Lorem ipsum")
// delete existing record files by specifying their file names
record.Set("documents-", []string{"file1_abc123.txt", "file3_abc123.txt"})
// append one or more new files to the already uploaded list
//
// note1: see all factories in https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/filesystem#File
// note2: for reading files from a request event you can also use e.FindUploadedFiles("fileKey")
f1, _ := filesystem.NewFileFromPath("/local/path/to/file1.txt")
f2, _ := filesystem.NewFileFromBytes([]byte{"test content"}, "file2.txt")
f3, _ := filesystem.NewFileFromURL(context.Background(), "https://example.com/file3.pdf")
record.Set("documents+", []*filesystem.File{f1, f2, f3})
// validate and persist
// (use SaveNoValidate to skip fields validation)
err = app.Save(record);
if err != nil {
    return err
}`

##### [Intercept update request](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-records/\#intercept-update-request)

`import (
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
)
...
app.OnRecordUpdateRequest("articles").Add(func(e *core.RecordRequestEvent) error {
    // ignore for superusers
    if e.HasSuperuserAuth() {
        return e.Next()
    }
    // overwrite the submitted "status" field value
    e.Record.Set("status", "pending")
    // or you can also prevent the create event by returning an error
    status := e.Record.GetString("status")
    if (status != "pending" &&
        // guest or not an editor
        (e.Auth == nil || e.Auth.GetString("role") != "editor")) {
        return e.BadRequestError("Only editors can set a status different from pending", nil)
    }
    return e.Next()
})`

### [Delete record](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-records/\#delete-record)

`record, err := app.FindRecordById("articles", "RECORD_ID")
if err != nil {
    return err
}
err = app.Delete(record)
if err != nil {
    return err
}`

### [Transaction](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-records/\#transaction)

To execute multiple queries in a transaction you can use
[`app.RunInTransaction(fn)`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core#BaseApp.RunInTransaction)
.

The DB operations are persisted only if the transaction returns `nil`.

It is safe to nest `RunInTransaction` calls as long as you use the callback's
`txApp` argument.

Inside the transaction function always use its `txApp` argument and not the original
`app` instance because we allow only a single writer/transaction at a time and it could
result in a deadlock.

To avoid performance issues, try to minimize slow/long running tasks such as sending emails,
connecting to external services, etc. as part of the transaction.

`import (
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
)
...
titles := []string{"title1", "title2", "title3"}
collection, err := app.FindCollectionByNameOrId("articles")
if err != nil {
    return err
}
// create new record for each title
app.RunInTransaction(func(txApp core.App) error {
    for _, title := range titles {
        record := core.NewRecord(collection)
        record.Set("title", title)
        if err := txApp.Save(record); err != nil {
            return err
        }
    }
    return nil
})`

### [Programmatically expanding relations](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-records/\#programmatically-expanding-relations)

To expand record relations programmatically you can use
[`app.ExpandRecord(record, expands, optFetchFunc)`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core#BaseApp.ExpandRecord)
for single or
[`app.ExpandRecords(records, expands, optFetchFunc)`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core#BaseApp.ExpandRecords)
for multiple records.

Once loaded, you can access the expanded relations via
[`record.ExpandedOne(relName)`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core#Record.ExpandedOne)
or
[`record.ExpandedAll(relName)`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core#Record.ExpandedAll) .

For example:

`record, err := app.FindFirstRecordByData("articles", "slug", "lorem-ipsum")
if err != nil {
    return err
}
// expand the "author" and "categories" relations
errs := app.ExpandRecord(record, []string{"author", "categories"}, nil)
if len(errs) > 0 {
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to expand: %v", errs)
}
// print the expanded records
log.Println(record.ExpandedOne("author"))
log.Println(record.ExpandedAll("categories"))`

### [Check if record can be accessed](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-records/\#check-if-record-can-be-accessed)

To check whether a custom client request or user can access a single record, you can use the
[`app.CanAccessRecord(record, requestInfo, rule)`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core#BaseApp.CanAccessRecord)
method.

Below is an example of creating a custom route to retrieve a single article and checking the request
satisfy the View API rule of the record collection:

`package main
import (
    "log"
    "net/http"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
)
func main() {
    app := pocketbase.New()
    app.OnServe().BindFunc(func(se *core.ServeEvent) error {
        se.Router.GET("/articles/{slug}", func(e *core.RequestEvent) error {
            slug := e.Request.PathValue("slug")
            record, err := e.App.FindFirstRecordByData("articles", "slug", slug)
            if err != nil {
                return e.NotFoundError("Missing or invalid slug", err)
            }
            info, err := e.RequestInfo()
            if err != nil {
                return e.BadRequestError("Failed to retrieve request info", err)
            }

### [Generating and validating tokens](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-records/\#generating-and-validating-tokens)

PocketBase Web APIs are fully stateless (aka. there are no sessions in the traditional sense) and an auth
record is considered authenticated if the submitted request contains a valid
`Authorization: TOKEN`
header
_(see also [Builtin auth middlewares](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-routing/#builtin-middlewares) and_
_[Retrieving the current auth state from a route](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-routing/#retrieving-the-current-auth-state)_
_)_
.

If you want to issue and verify manually a record JWT (auth, verification, password reset, etc.), you
could do that using the record token type specific methods:

`token, err := record.NewAuthToken()
token, err := record.NewVerificationToken()
token, err := record.NewPasswordResetToken()
token, err := record.NewEmailChangeToken(newEmail)
token, err := record.NewFileToken() // for protected files
token, err := record.NewStaticAuthToken(optCustomDuration) // non-refreshable auth token`

Each token type has its own secret and the token duration is managed via its type related collection auth
option ( _the only exception is `NewStaticAuthToken`_).

To validate a record token you can use the
[`app.FindAuthRecordByToken`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core#BaseApp.FindAuthRecordByToken)
method. The token related auth record is returned only if the token is not expired and its signature is valid.

Here is an example how to validate an auth token:

`record, err := app.FindAuthRecordByToken("YOUR_TOKEN", core.TokenTypeAuth)`

**[Batch create/update/upsert/delete records](https://pocketbase.io/docs/api-records/#batch-createupdateupsertdelete-records)**

Batch and transactional create/update/upsert/delete of multiple records in a single request.

The batch Web API need to be explicitly enabled and configured from the
_Dashboard > Settings > Application_.

Because this endpoint process the requests in a single read&write transaction, other queries
could queue up and it could degrade the performance of your application if not used with
proper care and configuration (couple recommendations: prefer using the smallest possible max
processing time limit, avoid large file uploads over slow S3 networks, restrict the body size
limit to something smaller, etc.).

## PocketBase Collection Operations
Collection operations

Collections are usually managed via the Dashboard interface, but there are some situations where you may
want to create or edit a collection programmatically (usually as part of a
[DB migration](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-migrations)). You can find all available Collection related operations
and methods in
[`core.App`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core#App)
and
[`core.Collection`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core#Collection)
, but below are listed some of the most common ones:

- [Fetch collections](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-collections/#fetch-collections)
  - [Fetch single collection](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-collections/#fetch-single-collection)
  - [Fetch multiple collections](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-collections/#fetch-multiple-collections)
  - [Custom collection query](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-collections/#custom-collection-query)
- [Collection properties](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-collections/#collection-properties)
- [Field definitions](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-collections/#field-definitions)
- [Create new collection](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-collections/#create-new-collection)
- [Update existing collection](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-collections/#update-existing-collection)
- [Delete collection](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-collections/#delete-collection)

### [Fetch collections](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-collections/\#fetch-collections)

##### [Fetch single collection](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-collections/\#fetch-single-collection)

All single collection retrieval methods return `nil` and `sql.ErrNoRows` error if no
collection is found.

`collection, err := app.FindCollectionByNameOrId("example")`

##### [Fetch multiple collections](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-collections/\#fetch-multiple-collections)

All multiple collections retrieval methods return empty slice and `nil` error if no collections
are found.

`allCollections, err := app.FindAllCollections()
authAndViewCollections, err := app.FindAllCollections(core.CollectionTypeAuth, core.CollectionTypeView)`

##### [Custom collection query](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-collections/\#custom-collection-query)

In addition to the above query helpers, you can also create custom Collection queries using
[`CollectionQuery()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core#CollectionQuery)
method. It returns a SELECT DB builder that can be used with the same methods described in the
[Database guide](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-database).

`import (
    "github.com/pocketbase/dbx"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
)
...
func FindSystemCollections(app core.App) ([]*core.Collection, error) {
    collections := []*core.Collection{}
    err := app.CollectionQuery().
        AndWhere(dbx.HashExp{"system": true}).
        OrderBy("created DESC").
        All(&collections)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    return collections, nil
}`

### [Collection properties](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-collections/\#collection-properties)

`Id      string

## PocketBase Migrations Guide
Migrations

PocketBase comes with a builtin DB and data migration utility, allowing you to version your DB structure,
create collections programmatically, initialize default settings and/or run anything that needs to be
executed only once.

The user defined migrations are located in `pb_migrations` directory (it can be changed using
the
`--migrationsDir` flag) and each unapplied migration inside it will be executed automatically
in a transaction on `serve` (or on `migrate up`).

The generated migrations are safe to be committed to version control and can be shared with your other
team members.

- [Automigrate](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-migrations/#automigrate)
- [Creating migrations](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-migrations/#creating-migrations)
  - [Migration file](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-migrations/#migration-file)
- [Collections snapshot](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-migrations/#collections-snapshot)
- [Migrations history](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-migrations/#migrations-history)
- [Examples](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-migrations/#examples)
  - [Executing raw SQL statements](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-migrations/#executing-raw-sql-statements)
  - [Initialize default application settings](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-migrations/#initialize-default-application-settings)
  - [Creating initial superuser](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-migrations/#creating-initial-superuser)
  - [Creating collection programmatically](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-migrations/#creating-collection-programmatically)

### [Automigrate](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-migrations/\#automigrate)

The prebuilt executable has the `--automigrate` flag enabled by default, meaning that every collection
configuration change from the Dashboard (or Web API) will generate the related migration file automatically
for you.

### [Creating migrations](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-migrations/\#creating-migrations)

To create a new blank migration you can run `migrate create`.

`[root@dev app]$ ./pocketbase migrate create "your_new_migration"`

`// pb_migrations/1687801097_your_new_migration.js
migrate((app) => {
    // add up queries...
}, (app) => {
    // add down queries...
})`

New migrations are applied automatically on `serve`.

Optionally, you could apply new migrations manually by running `migrate up`.


To revert the last applied migration(s), you could run `migrate down [number]`.


When manually applying or reverting migrations, the `serve` process needs to be restarted so
that it can refresh its cached collections state.

##### [Migration file](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-migrations/\#migration-file)

Each migration file should have a single `migrate(upFunc, downFunc)` call.

In the migration file, you are expected to write your "upgrade" code in the `upFunc` callback.


The `downFunc` is optional and it should contain the "downgrade" operations to revert the
changes made by the `upFunc`.

Both callbacks accept a transactional `app` instance.

### [Collections snapshot](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-migrations/\#collections-snapshot)

The `migrate collections` command generates a full snapshot of your current collections
configuration without having to type it manually. Similar to the `migrate create` command, this
will generate a new migration file in the
`pb_migrations` directory.

`[root@dev app]$ ./pocketbase migrate collections`

By default the collections snapshot is imported in _extend_ mode, meaning that collections and
fields that don't exist in the snapshot are preserved. If you want the snapshot to _delete_
missing collections and fields, you can edit the generated file and change the last argument of
`ImportCollectionsByMarshaledJSON`
to `true`.

### [Migrations history](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-migrations/\#migrations-history)

All applied migration filenames are stored in the internal `_migrations` table.


During local development often you might end up making various collection changes to test different approaches.


When `--automigrate` is enabled ( _which is the default_) this could lead in a migration
history with unnecessary intermediate steps that may not be wanted in the final migration history.

To avoid the clutter and to prevent applying the intermediate steps in production, you can remove (or
squash) the unnecessary migration files manually and then update the local migrations history by running:

`[root@dev app]$ ./pocketbase migrate history-sync`

The above command will remove any entry from the `_migrations` table that doesn't have a related
migration file associated with it.

### [Examples](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-migrations/\#examples)

##### [Executing raw SQL statements](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-migrations/\#executing-raw-sql-statements)

`// pb_migrations/1687801090_set_pending_status.js
migrate((app) => {
    app.db().newQuery("UPDATE articles SET status = 'pending' WHERE status = ''").execute()
})`

##### [Initialize default application settings](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-migrations/\#initialize-default-application-settings)

`// pb_migrations/1687801090_initial_settings.js
migrate((app) => {
    let settings = app.settings()
    // for all available settings fields you could check
    // /jsvm/interfaces/core.Settings.html
    settings.meta.appName = "test"
    settings.meta.appURL = "https://example.com"
    settings.logs.maxDays = 2
    settings.logs.logAuthId = true
    settings.logs.logIP = false
    app.save(settings)
})`

_For all supported record methods, you can refer to_
_[Record operations](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-records)_
.

`// pb_migrations/1687801090_initial_superuser.js
migrate((app) => {
    let superusers = app.findCollectionByNameOrId("_superusers")
    let record = new Record(superusers)
    // note: the values can be eventually loaded via $os.getenv(key)
    // or from a special local config file
    record.set("email", "test@example.com")
    record.set("password", "1234567890")
    app.save(record)
}, (app) => { // optional revert operation
    try {
        let record = app.findAuthRecordByEmail("_superusers", "test@example.com")
        app.delete(record)
    } catch {
        // silent errors (probably already deleted)
    }
})`

_For all supported collection methods, you can refer to_
_[Collection operations](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-collections)_
.

`// migrations/1687801090_create_clients_collection.js
migrate((app) => {

## Realtime API Overview
API Realtime

The Realtime API is implemented via Server-Sent Events (SSE). Generally, it consists of 2 operations:

1. establish SSE connection
2. submit client subscriptions

SSE events are sent for **create**, **update**
and **delete** record operations.

**You could subscribe to a single record or to an entire collection.**

When you subscribe to a **single record**, the collection's
**ViewRule** will be used to determine whether the subscriber has access to receive the
event message.

When you subscribe to an **entire collection**, the collection's
**ListRule** will be used to determine whether the subscriber has access to receive the
event message.

**[Connect](https://pocketbase.io/docs/api-realtime/#connect)**

**GET**

/api/realtime

Establishes a new SSE connection and immediately sends a `PB_CONNECT` SSE event with the
created client ID.

**NB!** The user/superuser authorization happens during the first
[Set subscriptions](https://pocketbase.io/docs/api-realtime#set-subscriptions)
call.

If the connected client doesn't receive any new messages for 5 minutes, the server will send a
disconnect signal (this is to prevent forgotten/leaked connections). The connection will be
automatically reestablished if the client is still active (e.g. the browser tab is still open).

**[Set subscriptions](https://pocketbase.io/docs/api-realtime/#set-subscriptions)**

**POST**

/api/realtime

Sets new active client's subscriptions (and auto unsubscribes from the previous ones).

If `Authorization` header is set, will authorize the client SSE connection with the
associated user or superuser.

Body Parameters

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RequiredclientId | String | ID of the SSE client connection. |
| Optionalsubscriptions | Array<String> | The new client subscriptions to set in the format:<br> <br>`COLLECTION_ID_OR_NAME` or<br>`COLLECTION_ID_OR_NAME/RECORD_ID`.<br>You can also attach optional query and header parameters as serialized json to a<br>single topic using the `options`<br>query parameter, e.g.:<br> <br>`COLLECTION_ID_OR_NAME/RECORD_ID?options={"query": {"abc": "123"}, "headers": {"x-token": "..."}}`<br>Leave empty to unsubscribe from everything. |

Body parameters could be sent as _JSON_ or
_multipart/form-data_.

## PocketBase Migrations Guide
Migrations

PocketBase comes with a builtin DB and data migration utility, allowing you to version your DB structure,
create collections programmatically, initialize default settings, etc.

Because the migrations are regular Go functions, besides applying schema changes, they could be used also
to adjust existing data to fit the new schema or any other app specific logic that you want to run only
once.

And as a bonus, being `.go` files also ensure that the migrations will be embedded seamlessly in
your final executable.

### [Quick setup](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-migrations/\#quick-setup)

##### [0\. Register the migrate command](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-migrations/\#0-register-the-migrate-command)

_You can find all available config options in the_
_[`migratecmd`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/plugins/migratecmd)_
_subpackage._

`// main.go
package main
import (
    "log"
    "strings"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/plugins/migratecmd"
    // enable once you have at least one migration
    // _ "yourpackage/migrations"
)
func main() {
    app := pocketbase.New()
    // loosely check if it was executed using "go run"
    isGoRun := strings.HasPrefix(os.Args[0], os.TempDir())
    migratecmd.MustRegister(app, app.RootCmd, migratecmd.Config{
        // enable auto creation of migration files when making collection changes in the Dashboard
        // (the isGoRun check is to enable it only during development)
        Automigrate: isGoRun,
    })
    if err := app.Start(); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}`

##### [1\. Create new migration](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-migrations/\#1-create-new-migration)

To create a new blank migration you can run `migrate create`.

`// Since the "create" command makes sense only during development,
// it is expected the user to be in the app working directory
// and to be using "go run"
[root@dev app]$ go run . migrate create "your_new_migration"`

`// migrations/1655834400_your_new_migration.go
package migrations
import (
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
    m "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/migrations"
)
func init() {
    m.Register(func(app core.App) error {
        // add up queries...
        return nil
    }, func(app core.App) error {
        // add down queries...
        return nil
    })
}`

The above will create a new blank migration file inside the default command `migrations` directory.

Each migration file should have a single `m.Register(upFunc, downFunc)` call.

In the migration file, you are expected to write your "upgrade" code in the `upFunc` callback.


The `downFunc` is optional and it should contain the "downgrade" operations to revert the
changes made by the `upFunc`.


Both callbacks accept a transactional `core.App` instance.

You can explore the
[Database guide](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-database),
[Collection operations](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-collections) and
[Record operations](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-records)
for more details how to interact with the database. You can also find
[some examples](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-migrations/#examples) further below in ths guide.

##### [2\. Load migrations](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-migrations/\#2-load-migrations)

To make your application aware of the registered migrations, you have to import the above
`migrations` package in one of your `main` package files:

`package main
import _ "yourpackage/migrations"
// ...`

##### [3\. Run migrations](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-migrations/\#3-run-migrations)

New unapplied migrations are automatically executed when the application server starts, aka. on
`serve`.

Alternatively, you can also apply new migrations manually by running `migrate up`.


To revert the last applied migration(s), you can run `migrate down [number]`.


When manually applying or reverting migrations, the `serve` process needs to be restarted so
that it can refresh its cached collections state.

### [Collections snapshot](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-migrations/\#collections-snapshot)

The `migrate collections` command generates a full snapshot of your current collections
configuration without having to type it manually. Similar to the `migrate create` command, this
will generate a new migration file in the
`migrations` directory.

`// Since the "collections" command makes sense only during development,
// it is expected the user to be in the app working directory
// and to be using "go run"
[root@dev app]$ go run . migrate collections`

By default the collections snapshot is imported in _extend_ mode, meaning that collections and
fields that don't exist in the snapshot are preserved. If you want the snapshot to _delete_
missing collections and fields, you can edit the generated file and change the last argument of
`ImportCollectionsByMarshaledJSON` method to `true`.

### [Migrations history](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-migrations/\#migrations-history)

All applied migration filenames are stored in the internal `_migrations` table.


During local development often you might end up making various collection changes to test different approaches.


When `Automigrate` is enabled this could lead in a migration history with unnecessary intermediate
steps that may not be wanted in the final migration history.

To avoid the clutter and to prevent applying the intermediate steps in production, you can remove (or
squash) the unnecessary migration files manually and then update the local migrations history by running:

`[root@dev app]$ go run . migrate history-sync`

The above command will remove any entry from the `_migrations` table that doesn't have a related
migration file associated with it.

### [Examples](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-migrations/\#examples)

##### [Executing raw SQL statements](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-migrations/\#executing-raw-sql-statements)

`// migrations/1687801090_set_pending_status.go
package migrations
import (
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
    m "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/migrations"
)
// set a default "pending" status to all empty status articles
func init() {
    m.Register(func(app core.App) error {
        _, err := app.DB().NewQuery("UPDATE articles SET status = 'pending' WHERE status = ''").Execute()
        return err
    }, nil)
}`

##### [Initialize default application settings](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-migrations/\#initialize-default-application-settings)

`// migrations/1687801090_initial_settings.go
package migrations
import (
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"

        settings := app.Settings()
        // for all available settings fields you could check
        // https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/blob/develop/core/settings_model.go#L121-L130
        settings.Meta.AppName = "test"
        settings.Meta.AppURL = "https://example.com"
        settings.Logs.MaxDays = 2
        settings.Logs.LogAuthId = true
        settings.Logs.LogIP = false
        return app.Save(settings)
    }, nil)
}`

##### [Creating initial superuser](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-migrations/\#creating-initial-superuser)

_For all supported record methods, you can refer to_
_[Record operations](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-records)_
.

_You can also create the initial super user using the_
_`./pocketbase superuser create EMAIL PASS`_
_command._

`// migrations/1687801090_initial_superuser.go
package migrations
import (
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
    m "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/migrations"
)

    m.Register(func(app core.App) error {
        superusers, err := app.FindCollectionByNameOrId(core.CollectionNameSuperusers)
        if err != nil {
            return err
        }
        record := core.NewRecord(superusers)
        // note: the values can be eventually loaded via os.Getenv(key)
        // or from a special local config file
        record.Set("email", "test@example.com")
        record.Set("password", "1234567890")
        return app.Save(record)
    }, func(app core.App) error { // optional revert operation
        record, _ := app.FindAuthRecordByEmail(core.CollectionNameSuperusers, "test@example.com")
        if record == nil {
            return nil // probably already deleted
        }
        return app.Delete(record)
    })
}`

##### [Creating collection programmatically](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-migrations/\#creating-collection-programmatically)

_For all supported collection methods, you can refer to_
_[Collection operations](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-collections)_
.

## Go Database Operations
Database

[`core.App`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core#App)
is the main interface to interact with the database.

`App.DB()` returns a `dbx.Builder` that could run all kind of SQL statements, including
raw queries.

Most of the common DB operations are listed below, but you can find further information in the
[dbx package godoc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/dbx).

For more details and examples how to interact with Record and Collection models programmatically
you could also check [Collection operations](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-collections)
and
[Record operations](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-records) sections.

### [Executing queries](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-database/\#executing-queries)

To execute DB queries you can start with the `NewQuery("...")` statement and then call one of:

- ` Execute() `
\- for any query statement that is not meant to retrieve data:

`res, err := app.DB().
      NewQuery("DELETE FROM articles WHERE status = 'archived'").
      Execute()`

- ` One() `
\- to populate a single row into a struct:

``type User struct {
      Id     string                  `db:"id" json:"id"`
      Status bool                    `db:"status" json:"status"`
      Age    int                     `db:"age" json:"age"`
      Roles  types.JSONArray[string] `db:"roles" json:"roles"`
}
user := User{}
err := app.DB().
      NewQuery("SELECT id, status, age, roles FROM users WHERE id=1").
      One(&user)``

- ` All() `
\- to populate multiple rows into a slice of structs:

``type User struct {
      Id     string                  `db:"id" json:"id"`
      Status bool                    `db:"status" json:"status"`
      Age    int                     `db:"age" json:"age"`
      Roles  types.JSONArray[string] `db:"roles" json:"roles"`
}
users := []User{}
err := app.DB().
      NewQuery("SELECT id, status, age, roles FROM users LIMIT 100").
      All(&users)``


### [Binding parameters](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-database/\#binding-parameters)

To prevent SQL injection attacks, you should use named parameters for any expression value that comes from
user input. This could be done using the named `{:paramName}`
placeholders in your SQL statement and then define the parameter values for the query with
`Bind(params)`. For example:

``type Post struct {
    Name     string         `db:"name" json:"name"`
    Created  types.DateTime `db:"created" json:"created"`
}
posts := []Post{}
err := app.DB().
    NewQuery("SELECT name, created FROM posts WHERE created >= {:from} and created <= {:to}").
    Bind(dbx.Params{
        "from": "2023-06-25 00:00:00.000Z",
        "to":   "2023-06-28 23:59:59.999Z",
    }).
    All(&posts)``

### [Query builder](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-database/\#query-builder)

Instead of writing plain SQLs, you can also compose SQL statements programmatically using the db query
builder.


Every SQL keyword has a corresponding query building method. For example, `SELECT` corresponds
to `Select()`, `FROM` corresponds to `From()`,
`WHERE` corresponds to `Where()`, and so on.

``users := []struct {
    Id    string `db:"id" json:"id"`
    Email string `db:"email" json:"email"`
}{}
app.DB().
    Select("id", "email").
    From("users").
    AndWhere(dbx.Like("email", "example.com")).
    Limit(100).
    OrderBy("created ASC").
    All(&users)``

##### [Select(), AndSelect(), Distinct()](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-database/\#select-andselect-distinct)

The `Select(...cols)` method initializes a `SELECT` query builder. It accepts a list
of the column names to be selected.


To add additional columns to an existing select query, you can call `AndSelect()`.


To select distinct rows, you can call `Distinct(true)`.

`app.DB().
    Select("id", "avatar as image").
    AndSelect("(firstName || ' ' || lastName) as fullName").
    Distinct(true)
    ...`

##### [From()](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-database/\#from)

The `From(...tables)` method specifies which tables to select from (plain table names are automatically
quoted).

`app.DB().
    Select("table1.id", "table2.name").
    From("table1", "table2")
    ...`

##### [Join()](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-database/\#join)

The `Join(type, table, on)` method specifies a `JOIN` clause. It takes 3 parameters:

- `type` \- join type string like `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, etc.
- `table` \- the name of the table to be joined
- `on` \- optional `dbx.Expression` as an `ON` clause

For convenience, you can also use the shortcuts `InnerJoin(table, on)`,
`LeftJoin(table, on)`,
`RightJoin(table, on)` to specify `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN` and
`RIGHT JOIN`, respectively.

`app.DB().
    Select("users.*").
    From("users").
    InnerJoin("profiles", dbx.NewExp("profiles.user_id = users.id")).
    Join("FULL OUTER JOIN", "department", dbx.NewExp("department.id = {:id}", dbx.Params{ "id": "someId" }))
    ...`

##### [Where(), AndWhere(), OrWhere()](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-database/\#where-andwhere-orwhere)

The `Where(exp)` method specifies the `WHERE` condition of the query.


You can also use `AndWhere(exp)` or `OrWhere(exp)` to append additional one or more
conditions to an existing `WHERE` clause.


Each where condition accepts a single `dbx.Expression` (see below for full list).

`/*
SELECT users.*
FROM users
WHERE id = "someId" AND
    status = "public" AND
    name like "%john%" OR
    (
        role = "manager" AND
        fullTime IS TRUE AND
        experience > 10
    )
*/
app.DB().
    Select("users.*").
    From("users").
    Where(dbx.NewExp("id = {:id}", dbx.Params{ "id": "someId" })).
    AndWhere(dbx.HashExp{"status": "public"}).
    AndWhere(dbx.Like("name", "john")).
    OrWhere(dbx.And(
        dbx.HashExp{
            "role":     "manager",
            "fullTime": true,
        },
        dbx.NewExp("experience > {:exp}", dbx.Params{ "exp": 10 })
    ))
    ...`

The following `dbx.Expression` methods are available:

- ` dbx.NewExp(raw, optParams) `


Generates an expression with the specified raw query fragment. Use the `optParams` to bind
`dbx.Params` to the expression.

`dbx.NewExp("status = 'public'")
dbx.NewExp("total > {:min} AND total < {:max}", dbx.Params{ "min": 10, "max": 30 })`

- ` dbx.HashExp{k:v} `


Generates a hash expression from a map whose keys are DB column names which need to be filtered according
to the corresponding values.

`// slug = "example" AND active IS TRUE AND tags in ("tag1", "tag2", "tag3") AND parent IS NULL
dbx.HashExp{
      "slug":   "example",
      "active": true,
      "tags":   []any{"tag1", "tag2", "tag3"},
      "parent": nil,
}`

- ` dbx.Not(exp) `


Negates a single expression by wrapping it with `NOT()`.

`// NOT(status = 1)
dbx.Not(dbx.NewExp("status = 1"))`

- ` dbx.And(...exps) `


Creates a new expression by concatenating the specified ones with `AND`.

`// (status = 1 AND username like "%john%")
dbx.And(
      dbx.NewExp("status = 1"),
      dbx.Like("username", "john"),
)`

- ` dbx.Or(...exps) `


Creates a new expression by concatenating the specified ones with `OR`.

`// (status = 1 OR username like "%john%")
dbx.Or(
      dbx.NewExp("status = 1"),
      dbx.Like("username", "john")
)`

- ` dbx.In(col, ...values) `


Generates an `IN` expression for the specified column and the list of allowed values.

`// status IN ("public", "reviewed")
dbx.In("status", "public", "reviewed")`

- ` dbx.NotIn(col, ...values) `


Generates an `NOT IN` expression for the specified column and the list of allowed values.

`// status NOT IN ("public", "reviewed")
dbx.NotIn("status", "public", "reviewed")`

- ` dbx.Like(col, ...values) `


Generates a `LIKE` expression for the specified column and the possible strings that the
column should be like. If multiple values are present, the column should be like
**all** of them.



By default, each value will be surrounded by _"%"_ to enable partial matching. Special
characters like _"%"_, _"\\"_, _"\_"_ will also be properly escaped. You may call
`Escape(...pairs)` and/or `Match(left, right)` to change the default behavior.

`// name LIKE "%test1%" AND name LIKE "%test2%"
dbx.Like("name", "test1", "test2")
// name LIKE "test1%"
dbx.Like("name", "test1").Match(false, true)`

- ` dbx.NotLike(col, ...values) `


Generates a `NOT LIKE` expression in similar manner as `Like()`.

`// name NOT LIKE "%test1%" AND name NOT LIKE "%test2%"
dbx.NotLike("name", "test1", "test2")
// name NOT LIKE "test1%"
dbx.NotLike("name", "test1").Match(false, true)`

- ` dbx.OrLike(col, ...values) `


This is similar to `Like()` except that the column must be one of the provided values, aka.
multiple values are concatenated with `OR` instead of `AND`.

`// name LIKE "%test1%" OR name LIKE "%test2%"
dbx.OrLike("name", "test1", "test2")
// name LIKE "test1%" OR name LIKE "test2%"
dbx.OrLike("name", "test1", "test2").Match(false, true)`

- ` dbx.OrNotLike(col, ...values) `


This is similar to `NotLike()` except that the column must not be one of the provided
values, aka. multiple values are concatenated with `OR` instead of `AND`.

`// name NOT LIKE "%test1%" OR name NOT LIKE "%test2%"
dbx.OrNotLike("name", "test1", "test2")
// name NOT LIKE "test1%" OR name NOT LIKE "test2%"
dbx.OrNotLike("name", "test1", "test2").Match(false, true)`

- ` dbx.Exists(exp) `


Prefix with `EXISTS` the specified expression (usually a subquery).

`// EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE status = 'active')
dbx.Exists(dbx.NewExp("SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE status = 'active'"))`

- ` dbx.NotExists(exp) `


Prefix with `NOT EXISTS` the specified expression (usually a subquery).

`// NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE status = 'active')
dbx.NotExists(dbx.NewExp("SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE status = 'active'"))`

- ` dbx.Between(col, from, to) `


Generates a `BETWEEN` expression with the specified range.

`// age BETWEEN 3 and 99
dbx.Between("age", 3, 99)`

- ` dbx.NotBetween(col, from, to) `


Generates a `NOT BETWEEN` expression with the specified range.

`// age NOT BETWEEN 3 and 99
dbx.NotBetween("age", 3, 99)`


##### [OrderBy(), AndOrderBy()](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-database/\#orderby-andorderby)

The `OrderBy(...cols)` specifies the `ORDER BY` clause of the query.


A column name can contain _"ASC"_ or _"DESC"_ to indicate its ordering direction.


You can also use `AndOrderBy(...cols)` to append additional columns to an existing
`ORDER BY` clause.

`app.DB().
    Select("users.*").
    From("users").
    OrderBy("created ASC", "updated DESC").
    AndOrderBy("title ASC")
    ...`

##### [GroupBy(), AndGroupBy()](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-database/\#groupby-andgroupby)

The `GroupBy(...cols)` specifies the `GROUP BY` clause of the query.


You can also use `AndGroupBy(...cols)` to append additional columns to an existing
`GROUP BY` clause.

`app.DB().
    Select("users.*").
    From("users").
    GroupBy("department", "level")
    ...`

##### [Having(), AndHaving(), OrHaving()](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-database/\#having-andhaving-orhaving)

The `Having(exp)` specifies the `HAVING` clause of the query.


Similarly to
`Where(exp)`, it accept a single `dbx.Expression` (see all available expressions
listed above).


You can also use `AndHaving(exp)` or `OrHaving(exp)` to append additional one or
more conditions to an existing `HAVING` clause.

`app.DB().
    Select("users.*").
    From("users").
    GroupBy("department", "level").
    Having(dbx.NewExp("sum(level) > {:sum}", dbx.Params{ sum: 10 }))
    ...`

##### [Limit()](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-database/\#limit)

The `Limit(number)` method specifies the `LIMIT` clause of the query.

`app.DB().
    Select("users.*").
    From("users").
    Limit(30)
    ...`

##### [Offset()](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-database/\#offset)

The `Offset(number)` method specifies the `OFFSET` clause of the query. Usually used
together with `Limit(number)`.

`app.DB().
    Select("users.*").
    From("users").
    Offset(5).
    Limit(30)
    ...`

### [Transaction](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-database/\#transaction)

To execute multiple queries in a transaction you can use
[`app.RunInTransaction(fn)`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core#BaseApp.RunInTransaction)
.

The DB operations are persisted only if the transaction returns `nil`.

It is safe to nest `RunInTransaction` calls as long as you use the callback's
`txApp` argument.

Inside the transaction function always use its `txApp` argument and not the original
`app` instance because we allow only a single writer/transaction at a time and it could
result in a deadlock.

To avoid performance issues, try to minimize slow/long running tasks such as sending emails,
connecting to external services, etc. as part of the transaction.

`err := app.RunInTransaction(func(txApp core.App) error {
    // update a record
    record, err := txApp.FindRecordById("articles", "RECORD_ID")
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    record.Set("status", "active")
    if err := txApp.Save(record); err != nil {
        return err
    }
    // run a custom raw query (doesn't fire event hooks)
    rawQuery := "DELETE FROM articles WHERE status = 'pending'"
    if _, err := txApp.NonconcurrentDB().NewQuery(rawQuery).Execute(); err != nil {
        return err
    }
    return nil
})`

## Collection Operations
Collection operations

Collections are usually managed via the Dashboard interface, but there are some situations where you may
want to create or edit a collection programmatically (usually as part of a
[DB migration](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-migrations)). You can find all available Collection related operations
and methods in
[`$app`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/modules/_app.html)
and
[`Collection`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/classes/Collection.html)
, but below are listed some of the most common ones:

- [Fetch collections](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-collections/#fetch-collections)
  - [Fetch single collection](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-collections/#fetch-single-collection)
  - [Fetch multiple collections](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-collections/#fetch-multiple-collections)
  - [Custom collection query](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-collections/#custom-collection-query)
- [Field definitions](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-collections/#field-definitions)
- [Create new collection](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-collections/#create-new-collection)
- [Update existing collection](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-collections/#update-existing-collection)
- [Delete collection](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-collections/#delete-collection)

### [Fetch collections](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-collections/\#fetch-collections)

##### [Fetch single collection](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-collections/\#fetch-single-collection)

All single collection retrieval methods throw an error if no collection is found.

`let collection = $app.findCollectionByNameOrId("example")`

##### [Fetch multiple collections](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-collections/\#fetch-multiple-collections)

All multiple collections retrieval methods return an empty array if no collections are found.

`let allCollections = $app.findAllCollections(/* optional types */)
// only specific types
let authAndViewCollections := $app.findAllCollections("auth", "view")`

##### [Custom collection query](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-collections/\#custom-collection-query)

In addition to the above query helpers, you can also create custom Collection queries using
[`$app.collectionQuery()`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/functions/_app.collectionQuery.html)
method. It returns a SELECT DB builder that can be used with the same methods described in the
[Database guide](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-database).

`let collections = arrayOf(new Collection)
$app.collectionQuery().
    andWhere($dbx.hashExp({"viewRule": null})).
    orderBy("created DESC").
    all(collections)`

### [Field definitions](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-collections/\#field-definitions)

All collection fields _(with exception of the `JSONField`)_ are non-nullable and
uses a zero-default for their respective type as fallback value when missing.

- [`new BoolField({ ... })`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/classes/BoolField.html)
- [`new NumberField({ ... })`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/classes/NumberField.html)
- [`new TextField({ ... })`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/classes/TextField.html)
- [`new EmailField({ ... })`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/classes/EmailField.html)
- [`new URLField({ ... })`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/classes/URLField.html)
- [`new EditorField({ ... })`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/classes/EditorField.html)
- [`new DateField({ ... })`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/classes/DateField.html)
- [`new AutodateField({ ... })`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/classes/AutodateField.html)
- [`new SelectField({ ... })`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/classes/SelectField.html)
- [`new FileField({ ... })`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/classes/FileField.html)
- [`new RelationField({ ... })`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/classes/RelationField.html)
- [`new JSONField({ ... })`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/classes/JSONField.html)

### [Create new collection](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-collections/\#create-new-collection)

`// missing default options, system fields like id, email, etc. are initialized automatically
// and will be merged with the provided configuration
let collection = new Collection({
    type:       "base", // base | auth | view
    name:       "example",
    listRule:   null,
    viewRule:   "@request.auth.id != ''",
    createRule: "",
    updateRule: "@request.auth.id != ''",
    deleteRule: null,
    fields: [\
        {\
            name:     "title",\
            type:     "text",\
            required: true,\
            max: 10,\
        },\
        {\
            name:          "user",\
            type:          "relation",\
            required:      true,\
            maxSelect:     1,\
            collectionId:  "ae40239d2bc4477",\
            cascadeDelete: true,\
        },\
    ],
    indexes: [\
        "CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_user ON example (user)"\
    ],
})
// validate and persist
// (use saveNoValidate to skip fields validation)
$app.save(collection)`

### [Update existing collection](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-collections/\#update-existing-collection)

`let collection = $app.findCollectionByNameOrId("example")
// change the collection name
collection.name = "example_update"
// add new editor field
collection.fields.add(new EditorField({
    name:     "description",
    required: true,
}))
// change existing field
// (returns a pointer and direct modifications are allowed without the need of reinsert)
let titleField = collection.fields.getByName("title")
titleField.min = 10
// or: collection.indexes.push("CREATE INDEX idx_example_title ON example (title)")
collection.addIndex("idx_example_title", false, "title", "")
// validate and persist
// (use saveNoValidate to skip fields validation)
$app.save(collection)`

### [Delete collection](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-collections/\#delete-collection)

`let collection = $app.findCollectionByNameOrId("example")
$app.delete(collection)`

## PocketBase Record Operations
Record operations

The most common task when extending PocketBase probably would be querying and working with your collection
records.

You could find detailed documentation about all the supported Record model methods in

### [Set field value](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-records/\#set-field-value)

`// sets the value of a single record field
// (field type specific modifiers are also supported)
record.set("title", "example")
record.set("users+", "6jyr1y02438et52") // append to existing value
// populates a record from a data map
// (calls set() for each entry of the map)
record.load(data)`

### [Get field value](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-records/\#get-field-value)

`// retrieve a single record field value
// (field specific modifiers are also supported)
record.get("someField")            // -> any (without cast)
record.getBool("someField")        // -> cast to bool
record.getString("someField")      // -> cast to string
record.getInt("someField")         // -> cast to int
record.getFloat("someField")       // -> cast to float64
record.getDateTime("someField")    // -> cast to types.DateTime
record.getStringSlice("someField") // -> cast to []string
// retrieve the new uploaded files
// (e.g. for inspecting and modifying the file(s) before save)
record.getUnsavedFiles("someFileField")
// unmarshal a single json field value into the provided result
let result = new DynamicModel({ ... })
record.unmarshalJSONField("someJsonField", result)
// retrieve a single or multiple expanded data
record.expandedOne("author")     // -> as null|Record
record.expandedAll("categories") // -> as []Record
// export all the public safe record fields in a plain object
// (note: "json" type field values are exported as raw bytes array)
record.publicExport()`

### [Auth accessors](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-records/\#auth-accessors)

`record.isSuperuser() // alias for record.collection().name == "_superusers"
record.email()         // alias for record.get("email")
record.setEmail(email) // alias for record.set("email", email)
record.verified()         // alias for record.get("verified")
record.setVerified(false) // alias for record.set("verified", false)
record.tokenKey()        // alias for record.get("tokenKey")
record.setTokenKey(key)  // alias for record.set("tokenKey", key)
record.refreshTokenKey() // alias for record.set("tokenKey:autogenerate", "")
record.validatePassword(pass)
record.setPassword(pass)   // alias for record.set("password", pass)
record.setRandomPassword() // sets cryptographically random 30 characters string as password`

### [Copies](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-records/\#copies)

`// returns a shallow copy of the current record model populated
// with its ORIGINAL db data state and everything else reset to the defaults
// (usually used for comparing old and new field values)
record.original()
// returns a shallow copy of the current record model populated
// with its LATEST data state and everything else reset to the defaults
// (aka. no expand, no custom fields and with default visibility flags)
record.fresh()
// returns a shallow copy of the current record model populated
// with its ALL collection and custom fields data, expand and visibility flags
record.clone()`

### [Hide/Unhide fields](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-records/\#hideunhide-fields)

Collection fields can be marked as "Hidden" from the Dashboard to prevent regular user access to the field
values.

Record models provide an option to further control the fields serialization visibility in addition to the
"Hidden" fields option using the
[`record.hide(fieldNames...)`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/interfaces/core.Record.html#hide)
and
[`record.unhide(fieldNames...)`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/interfaces/core.Record.html#unhide)
methods.

Often the `hide/unhide` methods are used in combination with the `onRecordEnrich` hook
invoked on every record enriching (list, view, create, update, realtime change, etc.). For example:

`onRecordEnrich((e) => {
    // dynamically show/hide a record field depending on whether the current
    // authenticated user has a certain "role" (or any other field constraint)
    if (
        !e.requestInfo.auth ||
        (!e.requestInfo.auth.isSuperuser() && e.requestInfo.auth.get("role") != "staff")
    ) {
        e.record.hide("someStaffOnlyField")
    }
    e.next()
}, "articles")`

For custom fields, not part of the record collection schema, it is required to call explicitly
`record.withCustomData(true)` to allow them in the public serialization.

### [Fetch records](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-records/\#fetch-records)

##### [Fetch single record](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-records/\#fetch-single-record)

All single record retrieval methods throw an error if no record is found.

`// retrieve a single "articles" record by its id
let record = $app.findRecordById("articles", "RECORD_ID")
// retrieve a single "articles" record by a single key-value pair
let record = $app.findFirstRecordByData("articles", "slug", "test")
// retrieve a single "articles" record by a string filter expression
// (NB! use "{:placeholder}" to safely bind untrusted user input parameters)
let record = $app.findFirstRecordByFilter(
    "articles",
    "status = 'public' && category = {:category}",
    { "category": "news" },
)`

##### [Fetch multiple records](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-records/\#fetch-multiple-records)

All multiple records retrieval methods return an empty array if no records are found.

`// retrieve multiple "articles" records by their ids
let records = $app.findRecordsByIds("articles", ["RECORD_ID1", "RECORD_ID2"])
// retrieve the total number of "articles" records in a collection with optional dbx expressions
let totalPending = $app.countRecords("articles", $dbx.hashExp({"status": "pending"}))
// retrieve multiple "articles" records with optional dbx expressions
let records = $app.findAllRecords("articles",
    $dbx.exp("LOWER(username) = {:username}", {"username": "John.Doe"}),
    $dbx.hashExp({"status": "pending"}),
)
// retrieve multiple paginated "articles" records by a string filter expression
// (NB! use "{:placeholder}" to safely bind untrusted user input parameters)
let records = $app.findRecordsByFilter(
    "articles",                                    // collection
    "status = 'public' && category = {:category}", // filter
    "-published",                                   // sort
    10,                                            // limit
    0,                                             // offset
    { "category": "news" },                        // optional filter params
)`

##### [Fetch auth records](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-records/\#fetch-auth-records)

`// retrieve a single auth record by its email
let user = $app.findAuthRecordByEmail("users", "test@example.com")
// retrieve a single auth record by JWT
// (you could also specify an optional list of accepted token types)
let user = $app.findAuthRecordByToken("YOUR_TOKEN", "auth")`

##### [Custom record query](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-records/\#custom-record-query)

In addition to the above query helpers, you can also create custom Record queries using
[`$app.recordQuery(collection)`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/functions/_app.recordQuery.html)
method. It returns a SELECT DB builder that can be used with the same methods described in the
[Database guide](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-database).

`function findTopArticle() {
    let record = new Record();
    $app.recordQuery("articles")
        .andWhere($dbx.hashExp({ "status": "active" }))
        .orderBy("rank ASC")
        .limit(1)
        .one(record)
    return record
}
let article = findTopArticle()`

For retrieving **multiple** Record models with the `all()` executor, you can use
`arrayOf(new Record)`
to create an array placeholder in which to populate the resolved DB result.

`// the below is identical to
// $app.findRecordsByFilter("articles", "status = 'active'", '-published', 10)
// but allows more advanced use cases and filtering (aggregations, subqueries, etc.)
function findLatestArticles() {
    let records = arrayOf(new Record);
    $app.recordQuery("articles")
        .andWhere($dbx.hashExp({ "status": "active" }))
        .orderBy("published DESC")
        .limit(10)
        .all(records)
    return records
}
let articles = findLatestArticles()`

### [Create new record](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-records/\#create-new-record)

##### [Create new record programmatically](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-records/\#create-new-record-programmatically)

`let collection = $app.findCollectionByNameOrId("articles")
let record = new Record(collection)
record.set("title", "Lorem ipsum")
record.set("active", true)
// field type specific modifiers can also be used
record.set("slug:autogenerate", "post-")
// new files must be one or a slice of filesystem.File values
//
// note1: see all factories in /jsvm/modules/_filesystem.html
// note2: for reading files from a request event you can also use e.findUploadedFiles("fileKey")
let f1 = $filesystem.fileFromPath("/local/path/to/file1.txt")
let f2 = $filesystem.fileFromBytes("test content", "file2.txt")
let f3 = $filesystem.fileFromURL("https://example.com/file3.pdf")
record.set("documents", [f1, f2, f3])
// validate and persist
// (use saveNoValidate to skip fields validation)
$app.save(record);`

##### [Intercept create request](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-records/\#intercept-create-request)

`onRecordCreateRequest((e) => {
    // ignore for superusers
    if (e.hasSuperuserAuth()) {
        return e.next()
    }
    // overwrite the submitted "status" field value
    e.record.set("status", "pending")
    // or you can also prevent the create event by returning an error
    let status = e.record.get("status")
    if (
        status != "pending" &&
        // guest or not an editor
        (!e.auth || e.auth.get("role") != "editor")
    ) {
        throw new BadRequestError("Only editors can set a status different from pending")
    }
    e.next()
}, "articles")`

### [Update existing record](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-records/\#update-existing-record)

##### [Update existing record programmatically](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-records/\#update-existing-record-programmatically)

`let record = $app.findRecordById("articles", "RECORD_ID")
record.set("title", "Lorem ipsum")
// delete existing record files by specifying their file names
record.set("documents-", ["file1_abc123.txt", "file3_abc123.txt"])
// append one or more new files to the already uploaded list
//
// note1: see all factories in /jsvm/modules/_filesystem.html
// note2: for reading files from a request event you can also use e.findUploadedFiles("fileKey")
let f1 = $filesystem.fileFromPath("/local/path/to/file1.txt")
let f2 = $filesystem.fileFromBytes("test content", "file2.txt")
let f3 = $filesystem.fileFromURL("https://example.com/file3.pdf")
record.set("documents+", [f1, f2, f3])
// validate and persist
// (use saveNoValidate to skip fields validation)
$app.save(record);`

##### [Intercept update request](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-records/\#intercept-update-request)

`onRecordUpdateRequest((e) => {
    // ignore for superusers
    if (e.hasSuperuserAuth()) {
        return e.next()
    }
    // overwrite the submitted "status" field value
    e.record.set("status", "pending")
    // or you can also prevent the create event by returning an error
    let status = e.record.get("status")
    if (
        status != "pending" &&
        // guest or not an editor
        (!e.auth || e.auth.get("role") != "editor")
    ) {
        throw new BadRequestError("Only editors can set a status different from pending")
    }
    e.next()
}, "articles")`

### [Delete record](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-records/\#delete-record)

`let record = $app.findRecordById("articles", "RECORD_ID")
$app.delete(record)`

### [Transaction](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-records/\#transaction)

To execute multiple queries in a transaction you can use
[`$app.runInTransaction(fn)`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/functions/_app.runInTransaction.html)
.

The DB operations are persisted only if the transaction completes without throwing an error.

It is safe to nest `runInTransaction` calls as long as you use the callback's
`txApp` argument.

Inside the transaction function always use its `txApp` argument and not the original
`$app` instance because we allow only a single writer/transaction at a time and it could
result in a deadlock.

To avoid performance issues, try to minimize slow/long running tasks such as sending emails,
connecting to external services, etc. as part of the transaction.

`let titles = ["title1", "title2", "title3"]
let collection = $app.findCollectionByNameOrId("articles")
$app.runInTransaction((txApp) => {
    // create new record for each title
    for (let title of titles) {
        let record = new Record(collection)
        record.set("title", title)
        txApp.save(record)
    }
})`

### [Programmatically expanding relations](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-records/\#programmatically-expanding-relations)

To expand record relations programmatically you can use
[`$app.expandRecord(record, expands, customFetchFunc)`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/functions/_app.expandRecord.html)
for single or
[`$app.expandRecords(records, expands, customFetchFunc)`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/functions/_app.expandRecords.html)
for multiple records.

Once loaded, you can access the expanded relations via
[`record.expandedOne(relName)`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/interfaces/core.Record.html#expandedOne)
or
[`record.expandedAll(relName)` methods.](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/interfaces/core.Record.html#expandedAll)

For example:

`let record = $app.findFirstRecordByData("articles", "slug", "lorem-ipsum")
// expand the "author" and "categories" relations
$app.expandRecord(record, ["author", "categories"], null)
// print the expanded records
console.log(record.expandedOne("author"))
console.log(record.expandedAll("categories"))`

### [Check if record can be accessed](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-records/\#check-if-record-can-be-accessed)

To check whether a custom client request or user can access a single record, you can use the
[`$app.canAccessRecord(record, requestInfo, rule)`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/functions/_app.canAccessRecord.html)
method.

Below is an example of creating a custom route to retrieve a single article and checking the request
satisfy the View API rule of the record collection:

`routerAdd("GET", "/articles/{slug}", (e) => {
    let slug = e.request.pathValue("slug")
    let record = e.app.findFirstRecordByData("articles", "slug", slug)
    let canAccess = e.app.canAccessRecord(record, e.requestInfo(), record.collection().viewRule)
    if (!canAccess) {
        throw new ForbiddenError()
    }
    return e.json(200, record)
})`

### [Generating and validating tokens](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-records/\#generating-and-validating-tokens)

PocketBase Web APIs are fully stateless (aka. there are no sessions in the traditional sense) and an auth
record is considered authenticated if the submitted request contains a valid
`Authorization: TOKEN`
header
_(see also [Builtin auth middlewares](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-routing/#builtin-middlewares) and_
_[Retrieving the current auth state from a route](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-routing/#retrieving-the-current-auth-state)_
_)_
.

If you want to issue and verify manually a record JWT (auth, verification, password reset, etc.), you
could do that using the record token type specific methods:

`let token = record.newAuthToken()
let token = record.newVerificationToken()
let token = record.newPasswordResetToken()
let token = record.newEmailChangeToken(newEmail)
let token = record.newFileToken() // for protected files
let token = record.newStaticAuthToken(optCustomDuration) // non-refreshable auth token`

Each token type has its own secret and the token duration is managed via its type related collection auth
option ( _the only exception is `newStaticAuthToken`_).

To validate a record token you can use the
[`$app.findAuthRecordByToken`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/functions/_app.findAuthRecordByToken.html)
method. The token related auth record is returned only if the token is not expired and its signature is valid.

Here is an example how to validate an auth token:

`let record = $app.findAuthRecordByToken("YOUR_TOKEN", "auth")`

## PocketBase Go Overview
Overview

- [Getting started](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-overview/#getting-started)
- [Custom SQLite driver](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-overview/#custom-sqlite-driver)

### [Getting started](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-overview/\#getting-started)

PocketBase can be used as regular Go package that exposes various helpers and hooks to help you implement
you own custom portable application.

A new PocketBase instance is created via
[`pocketbase.New()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase#New)
or
[`pocketbase.NewWithConfig(config)`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase#NewWithConfig)
.

Once created you can register your custom business logic via the available
[event hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/)
and call
[`app.Start()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase#PocketBase.Start)
to start the application.

Below is a minimal example:

0. [Install Go 1.23+](https://go.dev/doc/install)
1. Create a new project directory with `main.go` file inside it.


As a reference, you can also explore the prebuilt executable
    [`example/base/main.go`](https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/blob/master/examples/base/main.go)
    file.

`package main
import (
       "log"
       "os"
       "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
       "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/apis"
       "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
)
func main() {
       app := pocketbase.New()
       app.OnServe().BindFunc(func(se *core.ServeEvent) error {
           // serves static files from the provided public dir (if exists)
           se.Router.GET("/{path...}", apis.Static(os.DirFS("./pb_public"), false))
           return se.Next()
       })
       if err := app.Start(); err != nil {
           log.Fatal(err)
       }
}`

2. To init the dependencies, run `go mod init myapp && go mod tidy`.
3. To start the application, run `go run . serve`.
4. To build a statically linked executable, run `go build`
    and then you can start the created executable with
    `./myapp serve`.

### [Custom SQLite driver](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-overview/\#custom-sqlite-driver)

**The general recommendation is to use the builtin SQLite setup** but if you need more
advanced configuration or extensions like ICU, FTS5, etc. you'll have to specify a custom driver/build.

Note that PocketBase by default doesn't require CGO because it uses the pure Go SQLite port
[modernc.org/sqlite](https://pkg.go.dev/modernc.org/sqlite), but this may not be the case when using a custom SQLite driver!

PocketBase v0.23+ added supported for defining a `DBConnect` function as app configuration to
load custom SQLite builds and drivers compatible with the standard Go `database/sql`.

**The `DBConnect` function is called twice** \- once for
`pb_data/data.db`
(the main database file) and second time for `pb_data/auxiliary.db` (used for logs and other ephemeral
system meta information).

If you want to load your custom driver conditionally and fallback to the default handler, then you can
call
[`core.DefaultDBConnect`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core#DefaultDBConnect)
.


_As a side-note, if you are not planning to use `core.DefaultDBConnect`_
_fallback as part of your custom driver registration you can exclude the default pure Go driver with_
_`go build -tags no_default_driver` to reduce the binary size a little (~4MB)._

Below are some minimal examples with commonly used external SQLite drivers:

## PocketBase Routing Guide
Routing

You can register custom routes and middlewares by using the top-level
[`routerAdd()`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/functions/routerAdd.html)
and
[`routerUse()`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/functions/routerUse.html)
functions.

### [Routes](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-routing/\#routes)

##### [Registering new routes](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-routing/\#registering-new-routes)

Every route have a path, handler function and eventually middlewares attached to it. For example:

`// register "GET /hello/{name}" route (allowed for everyone)
routerAdd("GET", "/hello/{name}", (e) => {
    let name = e.request.pathValue("name")
    return e.json(200, { "message": "Hello " + name })
})
// register "POST /api/myapp/settings" route (allowed only for authenticated users)
routerAdd("POST", "/api/myapp/settings", (e) => {
    // do something ...
    return e.json(200, {"success": true})
}, $apis.requireAuth())`

##### [Path parameters and matching rules](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-routing/\#path-parameters-and-matching-rules)

Because PocketBase routing is based on top of the Go standard router mux, we follow the same pattern
matching rules. Below you could find a short overview but for more details please refer to
[`net/http.ServeMux`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#ServeMux).

In general, a route pattern looks like `[METHOD ][HOST]/[PATH]`.

Route paths can include parameters in the format `{paramName}`.


You can also use `{paramName...}` format to specify a parameter that target more than one path
segment.

A pattern ending with a trailing slash `/` acts as anonymous wildcard and matches any requests
that begins with the defined route. If you want to have a trailing slash but to indicate the end of the
URL then you need to end the path with the special
`{$}` parameter.

If your route path starts with `/api/`
consider combining it with your unique app name like `/api/myapp/...` to avoid collisions
with system routes.

Here are some examples:

`// match "GET example.com/index.html"
routerAdd("GET", "example.com/index.html", ...)
// match "GET /index.html" (for any host)
routerAdd("GET", "/index.html", ...)
// match "GET /static/", "GET /static/a/b/c", etc.
routerAdd("GET", "/static/", ...)
// match "GET /static/", "GET /static/a/b/c", etc.
// (similar to the above but with a named wildcard parameter)
routerAdd("GET", "/static/{path...}", ...)
// match only "GET /static/" (if no "/static" is registered, it is 301 redirected)
routerAdd("GET", "/static/{$}", ...)
// match "GET /customers/john", "GET /customer/jane", etc.
routerAdd("GET", "/customers/{name}", ...)`

* * *

In the following examples `e` is usually
[`core.RequestEvent`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/interfaces/core.RequestEvent.html) value.

* * *

##### [Reading path parameters](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-routing/\#reading-path-parameters)

`let id = e.request.pathValue("id")`

##### [Retrieving the current auth state](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-routing/\#retrieving-the-current-auth-state)

The request auth state can be accessed (or set) via the `RequestEvent.auth` field.

`let authRecord = e.auth
let isGuest = !e.auth
// the same as "e.auth?.isSuperuser()"
let isSuperuser = e.hasSuperuserAuth()`

Alternatively you could also access the request data from the summarized request info instance
_(usually used in hooks like the `onRecordEnrich` where there is no direct access to the request)_.

`let info = e.requestInfo()
let authRecord = info.auth
let isGuest = !info.auth
// the same as "info.auth?.isSuperuser()"
let isSuperuser = info.hasSuperuserAuth()`

##### [Reading query parameters](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-routing/\#reading-query-parameters)

`let search = e.request.url.query().get("search")
// or via the parsed request info
let search = e.requestInfo().query["search"]`

##### [Reading request headers](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-routing/\#reading-request-headers)

`let token = e.request.header.get("Some-Header")
// or via the parsed request info
// (the header value is always normalized per the @request.headers.* API rules format)
let token = e.requestInfo().headers["some_header"]`

##### [Writing response headers](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-routing/\#writing-response-headers)

`e.response.header().set("Some-Header", "123")`

##### [Retrieving uploaded files](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-routing/\#retrieving-uploaded-files)

`// retrieve the uploaded files and parse the found multipart data into a ready-to-use []*filesystem.File
let files = e.findUploadedFiles("document")
// or retrieve the raw single multipart/form-data file and header
let [mf, mh] = e.request.formFile("document")`

##### [Reading request body](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-routing/\#reading-request-body)

Body parameters can be read either via
[`e.bindBody`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/interfaces/core.RequestEvent.html#bindBody)
OR through the parsed request info.

`// read the body via the parsed request object
let body = e.requestInfo().body
console.log(body.title)
// read/scan the request body fields into a typed object
const data = new DynamicModel({
    // describe the fields to read (used also as initial values)
    someTextField:   "",
    someIntValue:    0,
    someFloatValue:  -0,
    someBoolField:   false,
    someArrayField:  [],
    someObjectField: {}, // object props are accessible via .get(key)
})
e.bindBody(data)
console.log(data.sometextField)`

##### [Writing response body](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-routing/\#writing-response-body)

`// send response with JSON body
// (it also provides a generic response fields picker/filter if the "fields" query parameter is set)
e.json(200, {"name": "John"})
// send response with string body
e.string(200, "Lorem ipsum...")
// send response with HTML body
// (check also the "Rendering templates" section)
e.html(200, "<h1>Hello!</h1>")
// redirect
e.redirect(307, "https://example.com")
// send response with no body
e.noContent(204)
// serve a single file
e.fileFS($os.dirFS("..."), "example.txt")
// stream the specified reader
e.stream(200, "application/octet-stream", reader)
// send response with blob (bytes array) body
e.blob(200, "application/octet-stream", [ ... ])`

##### [Reading the client IP](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-routing/\#reading-the-client-ip)

`// The IP of the last client connecting to your server.
// The returned IP is safe and can be always trusted.
// When behind a reverse proxy (e.g. nginx) this method returns the IP of the proxy.
// (/jsvm/interfaces/core.RequestEvent.html#remoteIP)
let ip = e.remoteIP()
// The "real" IP of the client based on the configured Settings.trustedProxy header(s).
// If such headers are not set, it fallbacks to e.remoteIP().
// (/jsvm/interfaces/core.RequestEvent.html#realIP)
let ip = e.realIP()`

##### [Request store](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-routing/\#request-store)

The `core.RequestEvent` comes with a local store that you can use to share custom data between
[middlewares](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-routing/#middlewares) and the route action.

`// store for the duration of the request
e.set("someKey", 123)
// retrieve later
let val = e.get("someKey") // 123`

### [Middlewares](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-routing/\#middlewares)

Middlewares allow inspecting, intercepting and filtering route requests.


Middlewares can be registered both to a single route (by passing them after the handler) and globally usually
by using `routerUse(middleware)`.

##### [Registering middlewares](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-routing/\#registering-middlewares)

Here is a minimal example of a what global middleware looks like:

`// register a global middleware
routerUse((e) => {
    if (e.request.header.get("Something") == "") {
        throw new BadRequestError("Something header value is missing!")
    }
    return e.next()
})`

Middleware can be either registered as simple functions ( `function(e){}` ) or if you want
to specify a custom priority and id - as a
[`Middleware`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/classes/Middleware.html)
class instance.

Below is a slightly more advanced example showing all options and the execution sequence:

`// attach global middleware
routerUse((e) => {
    console.log(1)
    return e.next()
})
// attach global middleware with a custom priority
routerUse(new Middleware((e) => {
console.log(2)
return e.next()
}, -1))
// attach middleware to a single route
//
// "GET /hello" should print the sequence: 2,1,3,4
routerAdd("GET", "/hello", (e) => {
    console.log(4)
    return e.string(200, "Hello!")
}, (e) => {
    console.log(3)
    return e.next()
})`

##### [Builtin middlewares](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-routing/\#builtin-middlewares)

The global
[`$apis.*`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/modules/_apis.html)
object exposes several middlewares that you can use as part of your application.

`// Require the request client to be unauthenticated (aka. guest).
$apis.requireGuestOnly()
// Require the request client to be authenticated
// (optionally specify a list of allowed auth collection names, default to any).
$apis.requireAuth(optCollectionNames...)
// Require the request client to be authenticated as superuser
// (this is an alias for $apis.requireAuth("_superusers")).
$apis.requireSuperuserAuth()
// Require the request client to be authenticated as superuser OR
// regular auth record with id matching the specified route parameter (default to "id").
$apis.requireSuperuserOrOwnerAuth(ownerIdParam)
// Changes the global 32MB default request body size limit (set it to 0 for no limit).
// Note that system record routes have dynamic body size limit based on their collection field types.
$apis.bodyLimit(limitBytes)
// Compresses the HTTP response using Gzip compression scheme.
$apis.gzip()
// Instructs the activity logger to log only requests that have failed/returned an error.
$apis.skipSuccessActivityLog()`

##### [Default globally registered middlewares](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-routing/\#default-globally-registered-middlewares)

The below list is mostly useful for users that may want to plug their own custom middlewares before/after
the priority of the default global ones, for example: registering a custom auth loader before the rate
limiter with `-1001` so that the rate limit can be applied properly based on the loaded auth state.

All PocketBase applications have the below internal middlewares registered out of the box ( _sorted by their priority_):


- **WWW redirect**(id: pbWWWRedirect, priority: -99999)

_Performs www -> non-www redirect(s) if the request host matches with one of the values in_
_certificate host policy._
- **CORS**(id: pbCors, priority: -1041)

_By default all origins are allowed (PocketBase is stateless and doesn't rely on cookies) but this_
_can be configured with the `--origins` flag._
- **Activity logger**(id: pbActivityLogger, priority: -1040)

_Saves request information into the logs auxiliary database._
- **Auto panic recover**(id: pbPanicRecover, priority: -1030)

_Default panic-recover handler._
- **Auth token loader**(id: pbLoadAuthToken, priority: -1020)

_Loads the auth token from the `Authorization` header and populates the related auth_
_record into the request event (aka. `e.auth`)._
- **Security response headers**(id: pbSecurityHeaders, priority: -1010)

_Adds default common security headers ( `X-XSS-Protection`,_
_`X-Content-Type-Options`,_
_`X-Frame-Options`) to the response (can be overwritten by other middlewares or from_
_inside the route action)._
- **Rate limit**(id: pbRateLimit, priority: -1000)

_Rate limits client requests based on the configured app settings (it does nothing if the rate_
_limit option is not enabled)._
- **Body limit**(id: pbBodyLimit, priority: -990)

_Applies a default max ~32MB request body limit for all custom routes ( system record routes have_
_dynamic body size limit based on their collection field types). Can be overwritten on group/route_
_level by simply rebinding the `$apis.bodyLimit(limitBytes)` middleware._

### [Error response](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-routing/\#error-response)

PocketBase has a global error handler and every returned or thrown `Error` from a route or
middleware will be safely converted by default to a generic API error to avoid accidentally leaking
sensitive information (the original error will be visible only in the _Dashboard > Logs_ or when in
`--dev` mode).

To make it easier returning formatted json error responses, PocketBase provides
`ApiError` constructor that can be instantiated directly or using the builtin factories.


`ApiError.data` will be returned in the response only if it is a map of
`ValidationError` items.

`// construct ApiError with custom status code and validation data error
throw new ApiError(500, "something went wrong", {
    "title": new ValidationError("invalid_title", "Invalid or missing title"),
})
// if message is empty string, a default one will be set
throw new BadRequestError(optMessage, optData)      // 400 ApiError
throw new UnauthorizedError(optMessage, optData)    // 401 ApiError
throw new ForbiddenError(optMessage, optData)       // 403 ApiError
throw new NotFoundError(optMessage, optData)        // 404 ApiError
throw new TooManyrequestsError(optMessage, optData) // 429 ApiError
throw new InternalServerError(optMessage, optData)  // 500 ApiError`

### [Helpers](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-routing/\#helpers)

##### [Serving static directory](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-routing/\#serving-static-directory)

[`$apis.static()`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/functions/_apis.static.html)
serves static directory content from `fs.FS` instance.

Expects the route to have a `{path...}` wildcard parameter.

`// serves static files from the provided dir (if exists)
routerAdd("GET", "/{path...}", $apis.static($os.dirFS("/path/to/public"), false))`

##### [Auth response](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-routing/\#auth-response)

[`$apis.recordAuthResponse()`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/functions/_apis.recordAuthResponse.html)
writes standardized JSON record auth response (aka. token + record data) into the specified request body. Could
be used as a return result from a custom auth route.

`routerAdd("POST", "/phone-login", (e) => {
    const data = new DynamicModel({
        phone:    "",
        password: "",
    })
    e.bindBody(data)
    let record = e.app.findFirstRecordByData("users", "phone", data.phone)
    if !record.validatePassword(data.password) {
        // return generic 400 error as a basic enumeration protection
        throw new BadRequestError("Invalid credentials")
    }
    return $apis.recordAuthResponse(e, record, "phone")
})`

##### [Enrich record(s)](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-routing/\#enrich-records)

[`$apis.enrichRecord()`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/functions/_apis.enrichRecord.html)
and
[`$apis.enrichRecords()`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/functions/_apis.enrichRecords.html)
helpers parses the request context and enrich the provided record(s) by:

- expands relations (if `defaultExpands` and/or `?expand` query parameter is set)
- ensures that the emails of the auth record and its expanded auth relations are visible only for the
current logged superuser, record owner or record with manage access

These helpers are also responsible for triggering the `onRecordEnrich` hook events.

`routerAdd("GET", "/custom-article", (e) => {
    let records = e.app.findRecordsByFilter("article", "status = 'active'", "-created", 40, 0)
    // enrich the records with the "categories" relation as default expand
    $apis.enrichRecords(e, records, "categories")
    return e.json(200, records)
})`

### [Sending request to custom routes using the SDKs](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-routing/\#sending-request-to-custom-routes-using-the-sdks)

The official PocketBase SDKs expose the internal `send()` method that could be used to send requests
to your custom route(s).

JavaScript

Dart

`import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';
const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
await pb.send("/hello", {
    // for other options check
    // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch#options
    query: { "abc": 123 },
});`

`import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart';
final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
await pb.send("/hello", query: { "abc": 123 })`

[Prev: Event hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks) [Next: Database](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-database)

## PocketBase Logging Guide
Logging

`$app.logger()` could be used to writes any logs into the database so that they can be later
explored from the PocketBase _Dashboard > Logs_ section.

For better performance and to minimize blocking on hot paths, logs are written with debounce and
on batches:

- 3 seconds after the last debounced log write
- when the batch threshold is reached (currently 200)
- right before app termination to attempt saving everything from the existing logs queue

- [Custom log queries](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-logging/#custom-log-queries)

### [Logger methods](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-logging/\#logger-methods)

All standard
[`slog.Logger`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/interfaces/slog.Logger.html)
methods are available but below is a list with some of the most notable ones. Note that attributes are represented
as key-value pair arguments.

##### [debug(message, attrs...)](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-logging/\#debugmessage-attrs-)

`$app.logger().debug("Debug message!")
$app.logger().debug(
    "Debug message with attributes!",
    "name", "John Doe",
    "id", 123,
)`

##### [info(message, attrs...)](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-logging/\#infomessage-attrs-)

`$app.logger().info("Info message!")
$app.logger().info(
    "Info message with attributes!",
    "name", "John Doe",
    "id", 123,
)`

##### [warn(message, attrs...)](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-logging/\#warnmessage-attrs-)

`$app.logger().warn("Warning message!")
$app.logger().warn(
    "Warning message with attributes!",
    "name", "John Doe",
    "id", 123,
)`

##### [error(message, attrs...)](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-logging/\#errormessage-attrs-)

`$app.logger().error("Error message!")
$app.logger().error(
    "Error message with attributes!",
    "id", 123,
    "error", err,
)`

##### [with(attrs...)](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-logging/\#withattrs-)

`with(atrs...)` creates a new local logger that will "inject" the specified attributes with each
following log.

`const l = $app.logger().with("total", 123)
// results in log with data {"total": 123}
l.info("message A")
// results in log with data {"total": 123, "name": "john"}
l.info("message B", "name", "john")`

##### [withGroup(name)](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-logging/\#withgroupname)

`withGroup(name)` creates a new local logger that wraps all logs attributes under the specified
group name.

`const l = $app.logger().withGroup("sub")
// results in log with data {"sub": { "total": 123 }}
l.info("message A", "total", 123)`

### [Logs settings](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-logging/\#logs-settings)

You can control various log settings like logs retention period, minimal log level, request IP logging,
etc. from the logs settings panel:

![Logs settings screenshot](https://pocketbase.io/images/screenshots/logs.png)

### [Custom log queries](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-logging/\#custom-log-queries)

The logs are usually meant to be filtered from the UI but if you want to programmatically retrieve and
filter the stored logs you can make use of the
[`$app.logQuery()`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/functions/_app.logQuery.html) query builder method. For example:

`let logs = arrayOf(new DynamicModel({
    id:      "",
    created: "",
    message: "",
    level:   0,
    data:    {},
}))
// see https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-database/#query-builder
$app.logQuery().
    // target only debug and info logs
    andWhere($dbx.in("level", -4, 0)).
    // the data column is serialized json object and could be anything
    andWhere($dbx.exp("json_extract(data, '$.type') = 'request'")).
    orderBy("created DESC").
    limit(100).
    all(logs)`

[Prev: Filesystem](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-filesystem) [Next: Types reference](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/index.html)

## PocketBase Filesystem Guide
Filesystem

PocketBase comes with a thin abstraction between the local filesystem and S3.

To configure which one will be used you can adjust the storage settings from
_Dashboard > Settings > Files storage_ section.

The filesystem abstraction can be accessed programmatically via the
[`app.NewFilesystem()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core#BaseApp.NewFilesystem)
method.

Below are listed some of the most common operations but you can find more details in the
[`filesystem`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/filesystem)
subpackage.

Always make sure to call `Close()` at the end for both the created filesystem instance and
the retrieved file readers to prevent leaking resources.

- [Reading files](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-filesystem/#reading-files)
- [Saving files](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-filesystem/#saving-files)
- [Deleting files](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-filesystem/#deleting-files)

### [Reading files](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-filesystem/\#reading-files)

To retrieve the file content of a single stored file you can use
[`GetFile(key)`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/filesystem#System.GetFile)
.


Note that file keys often contain a **prefix** (aka. the "path" to the file). For record
files the full key is
`collectionId/recordId/filename`.


To retrieve multiple files matching a specific _prefix_ you can use
[`List(prefix)`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/filesystem#System.List)
.

The below code shows a minimal example how to retrieve a single record file and copy its content into a
`bytes.Buffer`.

`record, err := app.FindAuthRecordByEmail("users", "test@example.com")
if err != nil {
    return err
}
// construct the full file key by concatenating the record storage path with the specific filename
avatarKey := record.BaseFilesPath() + "/" + record.GetString("avatar")
// initialize the filesystem
fsys, err := app.NewFilesystem()
if err != nil {
    return err
}
defer fsys.Close()
// retrieve a file reader for the avatar key
r, err := fsys.GetFile(avatarKey)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
defer r.Close()
// do something with the reader...
content := new(bytes.Buffer)
_, err = io.Copy(content, r)
if err != nil {
    return err
}`

### [Saving files](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-filesystem/\#saving-files)

There are several methods to save _(aka. write/upload)_ files depending on the available file content
source:

- [`Upload([]byte, key)`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/filesystem#System.Upload)
- [`UploadFile(*filesystem.File, key)`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/filesystem#System.UploadFile)
- [`UploadMultipart(*multipart.FileHeader, key)`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/filesystem#System.UploadFile)

Most users rarely will have to use the above methods directly because for collection records the file
persistence is handled transparently when saving the record model (it will also perform size and MIME type
validation based on the collection `file` field options). For example:

`record, err := app.FindRecordById("articles", "RECORD_ID")
if err != nil {
    return err
}
// Other available File factories
// - filesystem.NewFileFromBytes(data, name)
// - filesystem.NewFileFromURL(ctx, url)
// - filesystem.NewFileFromMultipart(mh)
f, err := filesystem.NewFileFromPath("/local/path/to/file")
// set new file (can be single *filesytem.File or multiple []*filesystem.File)
// (if the record has an old file it is automatically deleted on successful Save)
record.Set("yourFileField", f)
err = app.Save(record)
if err != nil {
    return err
}`

### [Deleting files](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-filesystem/\#deleting-files)

Files can be deleted from the storage filesystem using
[`Delete(key)`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/filesystem#System.Delete)
.

Similar to the previous section, most users rarely will have to use the `Delete` file method directly
because for collection records the file deletion is handled transparently when removing the existing filename
from the record model (this also ensure that the db entry referencing the file is also removed). For example:

`record, err := app.FindRecordById("articles", "RECORD_ID")
if err != nil {
    return err
}
// if you want to "reset" a file field (aka. deleting the associated single or multiple files)
// you can set it to nil
record.Set("yourFileField", nil)
// OR if you just want to remove individual file(s) from a multiple file field you can use the "-" modifier
// (the value could be a single filename string or slice of filename strings)
record.Set("yourFileField-", "example_52iWbGinWd.txt")
err = app.Save(record)
if err != nil {
    return err
}`

## PocketBase Database Guide
Database

[`$app`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/modules/_app.html)
is the main interface to interact with your database.

`$app.db()`
returns a `dbx.Builder` that could run all kind of SQL statements, including raw queries.

For more details and examples how to interact with Record and Collection models programmatically
you could also check [Collection operations](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-collections)
and
[Record operations](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-records) sections.

### [Executing queries](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-database/\#executing-queries)

To execute DB queries you can start with the `newQuery("...")` statement and then call one of:

- ` execute() `
\- for any query statement that is not meant to retrieve data:

`$app.db()
      .newQuery("DELETE FROM articles WHERE status = 'archived'")
      .execute() // throw an error on db failure`

- ` one() `
\- to populate a single row into `DynamicModel` object:

`const result = new DynamicModel({
      // describe the shape of the data (used also as initial values)
      // the keys cannot start with underscore and must be a valid Go struct field name
      "id":     "",
      "status": false,
      "age":    0, // use -0 for a float value
      "roles":  [], // serialized json db arrays are decoded as plain arrays
})
$app.db()
      .newQuery("SELECT id, status, age, roles FROM users WHERE id=1")
      .one(result) // throw an error on db failure or missing row
console.log(result.id)`

- ` all() `
\- to populate multiple rows into an array of objects (note that the array must be created with
`arrayOf`):

`const result = arrayOf(new DynamicModel({
      // describe the shape of the data (used also as initial values)
      // the keys cannot start with underscore and must be a valid Go struct field name
      "id":     "",
      "status": false,
      "age":    0, // use -0 for a float value
      "roles":  [], // serialized json db arrays are decoded as plain arrays
}))
$app.db()
      .newQuery("SELECT id, status, age, roles FROM users LIMIT 100")
      .all(result) // throw an error on db failure
if (result.length > 0) {
      console.log(result[0].id)
}`


### [Binding parameters](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-database/\#binding-parameters)

To prevent SQL injection attacks, you should use named parameters for any expression value that comes from
user input. This could be done using the named `{:paramName}`
placeholders in your SQL statement and then define the parameter values for the query with
`bind(params)`. For example:

`const result = arrayOf(new DynamicModel({
    "name":    "",
    "created": "",
}))
$app.db()
    .newQuery("SELECT name, created FROM posts WHERE created >= {:from} and created <= {:to}")
    .bind({
        "from": "2023-06-25 00:00:00.000Z",
        "to":   "2023-06-28 23:59:59.999Z",
    })
    .all(result)
console.log(result.length)`

### [Query builder](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-database/\#query-builder)

Instead of writing plain SQLs, you can also compose SQL statements programmatically using the db query
builder.


Every SQL keyword has a corresponding query building method. For example, `SELECT` corresponds
to `select()`, `FROM` corresponds to `from()`,
`WHERE` corresponds to `where()`, and so on.

`const result = arrayOf(new DynamicModel({
    "id":    "",
    "email": "",
}))
$app.db()
    .select("id", "email")
    .from("users")
    .andWhere($dbx.like("email", "example.com"))
    .limit(100)
    .orderBy("created ASC")
    .all(result)`

##### [select(), andSelect(), distinct()](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-database/\#select-andselect-distinct)

The `select(...cols)` method initializes a `SELECT` query builder. It accepts a list
of the column names to be selected.


To add additional columns to an existing select query, you can call `andSelect()`.


To select distinct rows, you can call `distinct(true)`.

`$app.db()
    .select("id", "avatar as image")
    .andSelect("(firstName || ' ' || lastName) as fullName")
    .distinct(true)
    ...`

##### [from()](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-database/\#from)

The `from(...tables)` method specifies which tables to select from (plain table names are automatically
quoted).

`$app.db()
    .select("table1.id", "table2.name")
    .from("table1", "table2")
    ...`

##### [join()](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-database/\#join)

The `join(type, table, on)` method specifies a `JOIN` clause. It takes 3 parameters:

- `type` \- join type string like `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, etc.
- `table` \- the name of the table to be joined
- `on` \- optional `dbx.Expression` as an `ON` clause

For convenience, you can also use the shortcuts `innerJoin(table, on)`,
`leftJoin(table, on)`,
`rightJoin(table, on)` to specify `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN` and
`RIGHT JOIN`, respectively.

`$app.db()
    .select("users.*")
    .from("users")
    .innerJoin("profiles", $dbx.exp("profiles.user_id = users.id"))
    .join("FULL OUTER JOIN", "department", $dbx.exp("department.id = {:id}", {id: "someId"}))
    ...`

##### [where(), andWhere(), orWhere()](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-database/\#where-andwhere-orwhere)

The `where(exp)` method specifies the `WHERE` condition of the query.


You can also use `andWhere(exp)` or `orWhere(exp)` to append additional one or more
conditions to an existing `WHERE` clause.


Each where condition accepts a single `dbx.Expression` (see below for full list).

`/*
SELECT users.*
FROM users
WHERE id = "someId" AND
    status = "public" AND
    name like "%john%" OR
    (
        role = "manager" AND
        fullTime IS TRUE AND
        experience > 10
    )
*/
$app.db()
    .select("users.*")
    .from("users")
    .where($dbx.exp("id = {:id}", { id: "someId" }))
    .andWhere($dbx.hashExp({ status: "public" }))
    .andWhere($dbx.like("name", "john"))
    .orWhere($dbx.and(
        $dbx.hashExp({
            role:     "manager",
            fullTime: true,
        }),
        $dbx.exp("experience > {:exp}", { exp: 10 })
    ))
    ...`

The following `dbx.Expression` methods are available:

- ` $dbx.exp(raw, optParams) `


Generates an expression with the specified raw query fragment. Use the `optParams` to bind
parameters to the expression.

`$dbx.exp("status = 'public'")
$dbx.exp("total > {:min} AND total < {:max}", { min: 10, max: 30 })`

- ` $dbx.hashExp(pairs) `


Generates a hash expression from a map whose keys are DB column names which need to be filtered according
to the corresponding values.

`// slug = "example" AND active IS TRUE AND tags in ("tag1", "tag2", "tag3") AND parent IS NULL
$dbx.hashExp({
      slug:   "example",
      active: true,
      tags:   ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"],
      parent: null,
})`

- ` $dbx.not(exp) `


Negates a single expression by wrapping it with `NOT()`.

`// NOT(status = 1)
$dbx.not($dbx.exp("status = 1"))`

- ` $dbx.and(...exps) `


Creates a new expression by concatenating the specified ones with `AND`.

`// (status = 1 AND username like "%john%")
$dbx.and($dbx.exp("status = 1"), $dbx.like("username", "john"))`

- ` $dbx.or(...exps) `


Creates a new expression by concatenating the specified ones with `OR`.

`// (status = 1 OR username like "%john%")
$dbx.or($dbx.exp("status = 1"), $dbx.like("username", "john"))`

- ` $dbx.in(col, ...values) `


Generates an `IN` expression for the specified column and the list of allowed values.

`// status IN ("public", "reviewed")
$dbx.in("status", "public", "reviewed")`

- ` $dbx.notIn(col, ...values) `


Generates an `NOT IN` expression for the specified column and the list of allowed values.

`// status NOT IN ("public", "reviewed")
$dbx.notIn("status", "public", "reviewed")`

- ` $dbx.like(col, ...values) `


Generates a `LIKE` expression for the specified column and the possible strings that the
column should be like. If multiple values are present, the column should be like
**all** of them.



By default, each value will be surrounded by _"%"_ to enable partial matching. Special
characters like _"%"_, _"\\"_, _"\_"_ will also be properly escaped. You may call
`escape(...pairs)` and/or `match(left, right)` to change the default behavior.

`// name LIKE "%test1%" AND name LIKE "%test2%"
$dbx.like("name", "test1", "test2")
// name LIKE "test1%"
$dbx.like("name", "test1").match(false, true)`

- ` $dbx.notLike(col, ...values) `


Generates a `NOT LIKE` expression in similar manner as `like()`.

`// name NOT LIKE "%test1%" AND name NOT LIKE "%test2%"
$dbx.notLike("name", "test1", "test2")
// name NOT LIKE "test1%"
$dbx.notLike("name", "test1").match(false, true)`

- ` $dbx.orLike(col, ...values) `


This is similar to `like()` except that the column must be one of the provided values, aka.
multiple values are concatenated with `OR` instead of `AND`.

`// name LIKE "%test1%" OR name LIKE "%test2%"
$dbx.orLike("name", "test1", "test2")
// name LIKE "test1%" OR name LIKE "test2%"
$dbx.orLike("name", "test1", "test2").match(false, true)`

- ` $dbx.orNotLike(col, ...values) `


This is similar to `notLike()` except that the column must not be one of the provided
values, aka. multiple values are concatenated with `OR` instead of `AND`.

`// name NOT LIKE "%test1%" OR name NOT LIKE "%test2%"
$dbx.orNotLike("name", "test1", "test2")
// name NOT LIKE "test1%" OR name NOT LIKE "test2%"
$dbx.orNotLike("name", "test1", "test2").match(false, true)`

- ` $dbx.exists(exp) `


Prefix with `EXISTS` the specified expression (usually a subquery).

`// EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE status = 'active')
$dbx.exists(dbx.exp("SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE status = 'active'"))`

- ` $dbx.notExists(exp) `


Prefix with `NOT EXISTS` the specified expression (usually a subquery).

`// NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE status = 'active')
$dbx.notExists(dbx.exp("SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE status = 'active'"))`

- ` $dbx.between(col, from, to) `


Generates a `BETWEEN` expression with the specified range.

`// age BETWEEN 3 and 99
$dbx.between("age", 3, 99)`

- ` $dbx.notBetween(col, from, to) `


Generates a `NOT BETWEEN` expression with the specified range.

`// age NOT BETWEEN 3 and 99
$dbx.notBetween("age", 3, 99)`


##### [orderBy(), andOrderBy()](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-database/\#orderby-andorderby)

The `orderBy(...cols)` specifies the `ORDER BY` clause of the query.


A column name can contain _"ASC"_ or _"DESC"_ to indicate its ordering direction.


You can also use `andOrderBy(...cols)` to append additional columns to an existing
`ORDER BY` clause.

`$app.db()
    .select("users.*")
    .from("users")
    .orderBy("created ASC", "updated DESC")
    .andOrderBy("title ASC")
    ...`

##### [groupBy(), andGroupBy()](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-database/\#groupby-andgroupby)

The `groupBy(...cols)` specifies the `GROUP BY` clause of the query.


You can also use `andGroupBy(...cols)` to append additional columns to an existing
`GROUP BY` clause.

`$app.db()
    .select("users.*")
    .from("users")
    .groupBy("department", "level")
    ...`

##### [having(), andHaving(), orHaving()](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-database/\#having-andhaving-orhaving)

The `having(exp)` specifies the `HAVING` clause of the query.


Similarly to
`where(exp)`, it accept a single `dbx.Expression` (see all available expressions
listed above).


You can also use `andHaving(exp)` or `orHaving(exp)` to append additional one or
more conditions to an existing `HAVING` clause.

`$app.db()
    .select("users.*")
    .from("users")
    .groupBy("department", "level")
    .having($dbx.exp("sum(level) > {:sum}", { sum: 10 }))
    ...`

##### [limit()](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-database/\#limit)

The `limit(number)` method specifies the `LIMIT` clause of the query.

`$app.db()
    .select("users.*")
    .from("users")
    .limit(30)
    ...`

##### [offset()](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-database/\#offset)

The `offset(number)` method specifies the `OFFSET` clause of the query. Usually used
together with `limit(number)`.

`$app.db()
    .select("users.*")
    .from("users")
    .offset(5)
    .limit(30)
    ...`

### [Transaction](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-database/\#transaction)

To execute multiple queries in a transaction you can use
[`$app.runInTransaction(fn)`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/functions/_app.runInTransaction.html)
.

The DB operations are persisted only if the transaction completes without throwing an error.

It is safe to nest `runInTransaction` calls as long as you use the callback's
`txApp` argument.

Inside the transaction function always use its `txApp` argument and not the original
`$app` instance because we allow only a single writer/transaction at a time and it could
result in a deadlock.

To avoid performance issues, try to minimize slow/long running tasks such as sending emails,
connecting to external services, etc. as part of the transaction.

`$app.runInTransaction((txApp) => {
    // update a record
    const record = txApp.findRecordById("articles", "RECORD_ID")
    record.set("status", "active")
    txApp.save(record)
    // run a custom raw query (doesn't fire event hooks)
    txApp.db().newQuery("DELETE FROM articles WHERE status = 'pending'").execute()
})`

## PocketBase Logging Guide
Logging

`app.Logger()` provides access to a standard `slog.Logger` implementation that
writes any logs into the database so that they can be later explored from the PocketBase
_Dashboard > Logs_ section.

For better performance and to minimize blocking on hot paths, logs are written with debounce and
on batches:

- 3 seconds after the last debounced log write
- when the batch threshold is reached (currently 200)
- right before app termination to attempt saving everything from the existing logs queue

- [Log methods](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-logging/#log-methods)
  - [Debug(message, attrs...)](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-logging/#debugmessage-attrs-)
  - [Info(message, attrs...)](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-logging/#infomessage-attrs-)
  - [Warn(message, attrs...)](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-logging/#warnmessage-attrs-)
  - [Error(message, attrs...)](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-logging/#errormessage-attrs-)
  - [With(attrs...)](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-logging/#withattrs-)
  - [WithGroup(name)](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-logging/#withgroupname)
- [Logs settings](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-logging/#logs-settings)
- [Custom log queries](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-logging/#custom-log-queries)

### [Log methods](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-logging/\#log-methods)

All standard
[`slog.Logger`](https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog)
methods are available but below is a list with some of the most notable ones.

##### [Debug(message, attrs...)](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-logging/\#debugmessage-attrs-)

`app.Logger().Debug("Debug message!")
app.Logger().Debug(
    "Debug message with attributes!",
    "name", "John Doe",
    "id", 123,
)`

##### [Info(message, attrs...)](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-logging/\#infomessage-attrs-)

`app.Logger().Info("Info message!")
app.Logger().Info(
    "Info message with attributes!",
    "name", "John Doe",
    "id", 123,
)`

##### [Warn(message, attrs...)](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-logging/\#warnmessage-attrs-)

`app.Logger().Warn("Warning message!")
app.Logger().Warn(
    "Warning message with attributes!",
    "name", "John Doe",
    "id", 123,
)`

##### [Error(message, attrs...)](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-logging/\#errormessage-attrs-)

`app.Logger().Error("Error message!")
app.Logger().Error(
    "Error message with attributes!",
    "id", 123,
    "error", err,
)`

##### [With(attrs...)](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-logging/\#withattrs-)

`With(atrs...)` creates a new local logger that will "inject" the specified attributes with each
following log.

`l := app.Logger().With("total", 123)
// results in log with data {"total": 123}
l.Info("message A")
// results in log with data {"total": 123, "name": "john"}
l.Info("message B", "name", "john")`

##### [WithGroup(name)](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-logging/\#withgroupname)

`WithGroup(name)` creates a new local logger that wraps all logs attributes under the specified
group name.

`l := app.Logger().WithGroup("sub")
// results in log with data {"sub": { "total": 123 }}
l.Info("message A", "total", 123)`

### [Logs settings](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-logging/\#logs-settings)

You can control various log settings like logs retention period, minimal log level, request IP logging,
etc. from the logs settings panel:

![Logs settings screenshot](https://pocketbase.io/images/screenshots/logs.png)

### [Custom log queries](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-logging/\#custom-log-queries)

The logs are usually meant to be filtered from the UI but if you want to programmatically retrieve and
filter the stored logs you can make use of the
[`app.LogQuery()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core#BaseApp.LogsQuery) query builder method. For example:

`logs := []*core.Log{}
// see https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-database/#query-builder
err := app.LogQuery().
    // target only debug and info logs
    AndWhere(dbx.In("level", -4, 0).
    // the data column is serialized json object and could be anything
    AndWhere(dbx.NewExp("json_extract(data, '$.type') = 'request'")).
    OrderBy("created DESC").
    Limit(100).
    All(&logs)`

## PocketBase Filesystem Guide
Filesystem

PocketBase comes with a thin abstraction between the local filesystem and S3.

To configure which one will be used you can adjust the storage settings from
_Dashboard > Settings > Files storage_ section.

The filesystem abstraction can be accessed programmatically via the
[`$app.newFilesystem()`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/functions/_app.newFilesystem.html)
method.

Below are listed some of the most common operations but you can find more details in the
[`filesystem.System`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/interfaces/filesystem.System.html)
interface.

Always make sure to call `close()` at the end for both the created filesystem instance and
the retrieved file readers to prevent leaking resources.

- [Reading files](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-filesystem/#reading-files)
- [Saving files](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-filesystem/#saving-files)
- [Deleting files](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-filesystem/#deleting-files)

### [Reading files](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-filesystem/\#reading-files)

To retrieve the file content of a single stored file you can use
[`getFile(key)`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/interfaces/filesystem.System.html#getFile)
.


Note that file keys often contain a **prefix** (aka. the "path" to the file). For record
files the full key is
`collectionId/recordId/filename`.


To retrieve multiple files matching a specific _prefix_ you can use
[`list(prefix)`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/interfaces/filesystem.System.html#list)
.

The below code shows a minimal example how to retrieve the content of a single record file as string.

`let record = $app.findAuthRecordByEmail("users", "test@example.com")
// construct the full file key by concatenating the record storage path with the specific filename
let avatarKey = record.baseFilesPath() + "/" + record.get("avatar")
let fsys, file, content;
try {
    // initialize the filesystem
    fsys = $app.newFilesystem();
    // retrieve a file reader for the avatar key
    file = fsys.getFile(avatarKey)
    // copy as plain string
    content = toString(file)
} finally {
    file?.close();
    fsys?.close();
}`

### [Saving files](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-filesystem/\#saving-files)

There are several methods to save _(aka. write/upload)_ files depending on the available file content
source:

- [`upload(content, key)`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/interfaces/filesystem.System.html#upload)
- [`uploadFile(file, key)`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/interfaces/filesystem.System.html#uploadFile)
- [`uploadMultipart(mfh, key)`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/interfaces/filesystem.System.html#uploadMultipart)

Most users rarely will have to use the above methods directly because for collection records the file
persistence is handled transparently when saving the record model (it will also perform size and MIME type
validation based on the collection `file` field options). For example:

`let record = $app.findRecordById("articles", "RECORD_ID")
// Other available File factories
// - $filesystem.fileFromBytes(content, name)
// - $filesystem.fileFromURL(url)
// - $filesystem.fileFromMultipart(mfh)
let file = $filesystem.fileFromPath("/local/path/to/file")
// set new file (can be single or array of File values)
// (if the record has an old file it is automatically deleted on successful save)
record.set("yourFileField", file)
$app.save(record)`

### [Deleting files](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-filesystem/\#deleting-files)

Files can be deleted from the storage filesystem using
[`delete(key)`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/interfaces/filesystem.System.html#delete)
.

Similar to the previous section, most users rarely will have to use the `delete` file method directly
because for collection records the file deletion is handled transparently when removing the existing filename
from the record model (this also ensure that the db entry referencing the file is also removed). For example:

`let record = $app.findRecordById("articles", "RECORD_ID")
// if you want to "reset" a file field (aka. deleting the associated single or multiple files)
// you can set it to null
record.set("yourFileField", null)
// OR if you just want to remove individual file(s) from a multiple file field you can use the "-" modifier
// (the value could be a single filename string or slice of filename strings)

## File Handling Guide
Files upload and handling

- [Uploading files](https://pocketbase.io/docs/files-handling/#uploading-files)
- [Deleting files](https://pocketbase.io/docs/files-handling/#deleting-files)
- [File URL](https://pocketbase.io/docs/files-handling/#file-url)
- [Protected files](https://pocketbase.io/docs/files-handling/#protected-files)
- [Storage options](https://pocketbase.io/docs/files-handling/#storage-options)

### [Uploading files](https://pocketbase.io/docs/files-handling/\#uploading-files)

To upload files, you must first add a `file` field to your collection:

![File field screenshot](https://pocketbase.io/images/screenshots/file-field.png)

Once added, you could create/update a Record and upload "documents" files by sending a
`multipart/form-data` request using the _Records create/update APIs_.

Each uploaded file will be stored with the original filename (sanitized) and suffixed with a
random part (usually 10 characters). For example `test_52iwbgds7l.png`.

The max allowed size of a single file currently is limited to ~8GB (253-1 bytes).

Here is an example how to create a new record and upload multiple files to the example "documents"
`file` field using the SDKs:

JavaScript

Dart

`import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';
const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
...
// create a new record and upload multiple files
// (files must be Blob or File instances)
const createdRecord = await pb.collection('example').create({
    title: 'Hello world!', // regular text field
    'documents': [\
        new File(['content 1...'], 'file1.txt'),\
        new File(['content 2...'], 'file2.txt'),\
    ]
});
// -----------------------------------------------------------
// Alternative FormData + plain HTML file input example
// <input type="file" id="fileInput" />
// -----------------------------------------------------------
const fileInput = document.getElementById('fileInput');
const formData = new FormData();
// set regular text field
formData.append('title', 'Hello world!');
// listen to file input changes and add the selected files to the form data
fileInput.addEventListener('change', function () {
    for (let file of fileInput.files) {
        formData.append('documents', file);
    }
});
...
// upload and create new record
const createdRecord = await pb.collection('example').create(formData);`

`import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
...
// create a new record and upload multiple files
final record = await pb.collection('example').create(
    body: {
        'title': 'Hello world!', // regular text field
    },
    files: [\
        http.MultipartFile.fromString(\
            'documents',\
            'example content 1...',\
            filename: 'file1.txt',\
        ),\
        http.MultipartFile.fromString(\
            'documents',\
            'example content 2...',\
            filename: 'file2.txt',\
        ),\
    ],
);`

If your `file` field supports uploading multiple files (aka.
**Max Files option is >= 2**) you can use the `+` prefix/suffix field name modifier
to respectively prepend/append new files alongside the already uploaded ones. For example:

JavaScript

Dart

`import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';
const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
...
const createdRecord = await pb.collection('example').update('RECORD_ID', {
    "documents+": new File(["content 3..."], "file3.txt")
});`

`import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
...
final record = await pb.collection('example').update(
    'RECORD_ID',
    files: [\
        http.MultipartFile.fromString(\
            'documents+',\
            'example content 3...',\
            filename: 'file3.txt',\
        ),\
    ],
);`

### [Deleting files](https://pocketbase.io/docs/files-handling/\#deleting-files)

To delete uploaded file(s), you could either edit the Record from the Dashboard, or use the API and set
the file field to a zero-value

(empty string, `[]`).

If you want to **delete individual file(s) from a multiple file upload field**, you could
suffix the field name with `-` and specify the filename(s) you want to delete. Here are some examples
using the SDKs:

JavaScript

Dart

`import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';
const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
...
// delete all "documents" files
await pb.collection('example').update('RECORD_ID', {
    'documents': [],
});
// delete individual files
await pb.collection('example').update('RECORD_ID', {
    'documents-': ["file1.pdf", "file2.txt"],
});`

`import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart';
final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
...
// delete all "documents" files
await pb.collection('example').update('RECORD_ID', body: {
    'documents': [],
});
// delete individual files
await pb.collection('example').update('RECORD_ID', body: {
    'documents-': ["file1.pdf", "file2.txt"],
});`

The above examples use the JSON object data format, but you could also use `FormData` instance
for _multipart/form-data_ requests. If using
`FormData` set the file field to an empty string.

### [File URL](https://pocketbase.io/docs/files-handling/\#file-url)

Each uploaded file could be accessed by requesting its file url:


`http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/files/COLLECTION_ID_OR_NAME/RECORD_ID/FILENAME`

If your file field has the **Thumb sizes** option, you can get a thumb of the image file
(currently limited to jpg, png, and partially gif – its first frame) by adding the `thumb`
query parameter to the url like this:
`http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/files/COLLECTION_ID_OR_NAME/RECORD_ID/FILENAME?thumb=100x300`

The following thumb formats are currently supported:

- **WxH**
(e.g. 100x300) - crop to WxH viewbox (from center)
- **WxHt**
(e.g. 100x300t) - crop to WxH viewbox (from top)
- **WxHb**
(e.g. 100x300b) - crop to WxH viewbox (from bottom)
- **WxHf**
(e.g. 100x300f) - fit inside a WxH viewbox (without cropping)
- **0xH**
(e.g. 0x300) - resize to H height preserving the aspect ratio
- **Wx0**
(e.g. 100x0) - resize to W width preserving the aspect ratio

The original file would be returned, if the requested thumb size is not found or the file is not an image!

If you already have a Record model instance, the SDKs provide a convenient method to generate a file url
by its name.

JavaScript

Dart

`import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';
const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
...
const record = await pb.collection('example').getOne('RECORD_ID');
// get only the first filename from "documents"
//
// note:
// "documents" is an array of filenames because
// the "documents" field was created with "Max Files" option > 1;
// if "Max Files" was 1, then the result property would be just a string
const firstFilename = record.documents[0];
// returns something like:
// http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/files/example/kfzjt5oy8r34hvn/test_52iWbGinWd.png?thumb=100x250
const url = pb.files.getURL(record, firstFilename, {'thumb': '100x250'});`

`import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart';
final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
...
final record = await pb.collection('example').getOne('RECORD_ID');
// get only the first filename from "documents"
//
// note:
// "documents" is an array of filenames because
// the "documents" field was created with "Max Files" option > 1;
// if "Max Files" was 1, then the result property would be just a string
final firstFilename = record.getListValue<String>('documents')[0];
// returns something like:
// http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/files/example/kfzjt5oy8r34hvn/test_52iWbGinWd.png?thumb=100x250
final url = pb.files.getURL(record, firstFilename, thumb: '100x250');`

Additionally, to instruct the browser to always download the file instead of showing a preview when
accessed directly, you can append the `?download=1` query parameter to the file url.

### [Protected files](https://pocketbase.io/docs/files-handling/\#protected-files)

By default all files are public accessible if you know their full url.

For most applications this is fine and reasonably safe because all files have a random part appended to
their name, but in some cases you may want an extra security to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive
files like ID card or Passport copies, contracts, etc.

To do this you can mark the `file` field as _Protected_ from its field options in the
Dashboard and then request the file with a special **short-lived file token**.

Only requests that satisfy the **View API rule** of the record collection will be able
to access or download the protected file(s).

JavaScript

Dart

`import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';
const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
...
// authenticate
await pb.collection('users').authWithPassword('test@example.com', '1234567890');
// generate a file token
const fileToken = await pb.files.getToken();
// retrieve an example protected file url (will be valid ~2min)
const record = await pb.collection('example').getOne('RECORD_ID');
const url = pb.files.getURL(record, record.myPrivateFile, {'token': fileToken});`

`import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart';
final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
...
// authenticate
await pb.collection('users').authWithPassword('test@example.com', '1234567890');
// generate a file token
final fileToken = await pb.files.getToken();
// retrieve an example protected file url (will be valid ~2min)
final record = await pb.collection('example').getOne('RECORD_ID');
final url = pb.files.getURL(record, record.getStringValue('myPrivateFile'), token: fileToken);`

### [Storage options](https://pocketbase.io/docs/files-handling/\#storage-options)

By default PocketBase stores uploaded files in the `pb_data/storage` directory on the local file
system. For the majority of cases this is usually the recommended storage option because it is very fast, easy
to work with and backup.

But if you have limited disk space you could switch to an external S3 compatible storage (AWS S3, MinIO,
Wasabi, DigitalOcean Spaces, Vultr Object Storage, etc.). The easiest way to setup the connection settings
is from the _Dashboard_ \> _Settings_ \> _Files storage_:

## PocketBase JavaScript Overview
Overview

- [JavaScript engine](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-overview/#javascript-engine)
  - [Global objects](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-overview/#global-objects)
- [TypeScript declarations and code completion](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-overview/#typescript-declarations-and-code-completion)
- [Caveats and limitations](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-overview/#caveats-and-limitations)
  - [Handlers scope](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-overview/#handlers-scope)
  - [Relative paths](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-overview/#relative-paths)
  - [Loading modules](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-overview/#loading-modules)
  - [Performance](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-overview/#performance)
  - [Engine limitations](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-overview/#engine-limitations)

### [JavaScript engine](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-overview/\#javascript-engine)

The prebuilt PocketBase v0.17+ executable comes with embedded ES5 JavaScript engine ( [goja](https://github.com/dop251/goja)) which enables you to write custom server-side code using plain JavaScript.

You can start by creating `*.pb.js` file(s) inside a `pb_hooks`
directory next to your executable.

`// pb_hooks/main.pb.js
routerAdd("GET", "/hello/{name}", (e) => {
    let name = e.request.pathValue("name")
    return e.json(200, { "message": "Hello " + name })
})
onRecordAfterUpdateSuccess((e) => {
    console.log("user updated...", e.record.get("email"))
    e.next()
}, "users")`

_For convenience, when making changes to the files inside `pb_hooks`, the process will_
_automatically restart/reload itself (currently supported only on UNIX based platforms). The_
_`*.pb.js` files are loaded per their filename sort order._

For most parts, the JavaScript APIs are derived from [Go](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-overview) with 2 main differences:

- Go exported method and field names are converted to camelCase, for example:


`app.FindRecordById("example", "RECORD_ID")` becomes
`$app.findRecordById("example", "RECORD_ID")`.
- Errors are thrown as regular JavaScript exceptions and not returned as Go values.

##### [Global objects](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-overview/\#global-objects)

Below is a list with some of the commonly used global objects that are accessible from everywhere:

- [`__hooks`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/variables/__hooks.html)
\- The absolute path to the app `pb_hooks` directory.
- [`$app`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/modules/_app.html) \- The current running PocketBase application instance.
- [`$apis.*`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/modules/_apis.html) \- API routing helpers and middlewares.
- [`$os.*`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/modules/_os.html) \- OS level primitives (deleting directories, executing shell commands, etc.).
- [`$security.*`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/modules/_security.html) \- Low level helpers for creating and parsing JWTs, random string generation, AES encryption, etc.
- And many more - for all exposed APIs, please refer to the
[JSVM reference docs](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/index.html).

### [TypeScript declarations and code completion](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-overview/\#typescript-declarations-and-code-completion)

While you can't use directly TypeScript ( _without transpiling it to JS on your own_), PocketBase
comes with builtin **ambient TypeScript declarations** that can help providing information
and documentation about the available global variables, methods and arguments, code completion, etc. as
long as your editor has TypeScript LSP support
_(most editors either have it builtin or available as plugin)_.

The types declarations are stored in
`pb_data/types.d.ts` file. You can point to those declarations using the
[reference triple-slash directive](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/triple-slash-directives.html#-reference-path-)
at the top of your JS file:

`/// <reference path="../pb_data/types.d.ts" />
onBootstrap((e) => {
    e.next()
    console.log("App initialized!")
})`

If after referencing the types your editor still doesn't perform linting, then you can try to rename your
file to have `.pb.ts` extension.

### [Caveats and limitations](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-overview/\#caveats-and-limitations)

##### [Handlers scope](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-overview/\#handlers-scope)

Each handler function (hook, route, middleware, etc.) is
**serialized and executed in its own isolated context as a separate "program"**. This means
that you don't have access to custom variables and functions declared outside of the handler scope. For
example, the below code will fail:

`const name = "test"
onBootstrap((e) => {
    e.next()
    console.log(name) // <-- name will be undefined inside the handler
})`

The above serialization and isolation context is also the reason why error stack trace line numbers may
not be accurate.

One possible workaround for sharing/reusing code across different handlers could be to move and export the
reusable code portion as local module and load it with `require()` inside the handler but keep in
mind that the loaded modules use a shared registry and mutations should be avoided when possible to prevent
concurrency issues:

``onBootstrap((e) => {
    e.next()
    const config = require(`${__hooks}/config.js`)
    console.log(config.name)
})``

##### [Relative paths](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-overview/\#relative-paths)

Relative file paths are relative to the current working directory (CWD) and not to the
`pb_hooks`.


To get an absolute path to the `pb_hooks` directory you can use the global
`__hooks` variable.

##### [Loading modules](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-overview/\#loading-modules)

Please note that the embedded JavaScript engine is not a Node.js or browser environment, meaning
that modules that relies on APIs like _window_, _fs_,
_fetch_, _buffer_ or any other runtime specific API not part of the ES5 spec may not
work!

You can load modules either by specifying their local filesystem path or by using their name, which will
automatically search in:

- the current working directory ( _affects also relative paths_)
- any `node_modules` directory
- any parent `node_modules` directory

Currently only CommonJS (CJS) modules are supported and can be loaded with
`const x = require(...)`.


ECMAScript modules (ESM) can be loaded by first precompiling and transforming your dependencies with a bundler
like
[rollup](https://rollupjs.org/),
[webpack](https://webpack.js.org/),
[browserify](https://browserify.org/), etc.

A common usage of local modules is for loading shared helpers or configuration parameters, for example:

`// pb_hooks/utils.js
module.exports = {
    hello: (name) => {
        console.log("Hello " + name)
    }
}`

``// pb_hooks/main.pb.js
onBootstrap((e) => {
    e.next()
    const utils = require(`${__hooks}/utils.js`)
    utils.hello("world")
})``

Loaded modules use a shared registry and mutations should be avoided when possible to prevent
concurrency issues.

##### [Performance](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-overview/\#performance)

The prebuilt executable comes with a **prewarmed pool of 15 JS runtimes**, which helps
maintaining the handlers execution times on par with the Go equivalent code (see
[benchmarks](https://github.com/pocketbase/benchmarks/blob/master/results/hetzner_cax11.md#go-vs-js-route-execution)). You can adjust the pool size manually with the `--hooksPool=50` flag ( _increasing the pool size may improve the performance in high concurrent scenarios but also will_
_increase the memory usage_).

Note that the handlers performance may degrade if you have heavy computational tasks in pure JavaScript
(encryption, random generators, etc.). For such cases prefer using the exposed [Go bindings](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/index.html)
(e.g. `$security.randomString(10)`).

##### [Engine limitations](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-overview/\#engine-limitations)

We inherit some of the limitations and caveats of the embedded JavaScript engine

( [goja](https://github.com/dop251/goja)):

- Has most of ES6 functionality already implemented but it is not fully spec compliant yet.
- No concurrent execution inside a single handler (aka. no `setTimeout`/ `setInterval`).
- Wrapped Go structural types (such as maps, slices) comes with some peculiarities and do not behave the
exact same way as native ECMAScript values (for more details see
[goja ToValue](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/dop251/goja#Runtime.ToValue)).
- In relation to the above, DB `json` field values require the use of `get()` and
`set()` helpers ( _this may change in the future_).

## PocketBase Testing Guide
Testing

PocketBase exposes several test mocks and stubs (eg. `tests.TestApp`,
`tests.ApiScenario`, `tests.MockMultipartData`, etc.) to help you write unit and
integration tests for your app.

You could find more information in the
[`github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tests`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tests)
sub package, but here is a simple example.

- [1\. Setup](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-testing/#1-setup)
- [2\. Prepare test data](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-testing/#2-prepare-test-data)
- [3\. Integration test](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-testing/#3-integration-test)

### [1\. Setup](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-testing/\#1-setup)

Let's say that we have a custom API route `GET /my/hello` that requires superuser authentication:

`// main.go
package main
import (
    "log"
    "net/http"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/apis"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
)
func bindAppHooks(app core.App) {
    app.OnServe().BindFunc(func(se *core.ServeEvent) error {
        se.Router.Get("/my/hello", func(e *core.RequestEvent) error {
            return e.JSON(http.StatusOK, "Hello world!")
        }).Bind(apis.RequireSuperuserAuth())
        return se.Next()
    })
}
func main() {
    app := pocketbase.New()
    bindAppHooks(app)
    if err := app.Start(); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}`

### [2\. Prepare test data](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-testing/\#2-prepare-test-data)

Now we have to prepare our test/mock data. There are several ways you can approach this, but the easiest
one would be to start your application with a custom `test_pb_data` directory, e.g.:

`./pocketbase serve --dir="./test_pb_data" --automigrate=0`

Go to your browser and create the test data via the Dashboard (both collections and records). Once
completed you can stop the server (you could also commit `test_pb_data` to your repo).

### [3\. Integration test](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-testing/\#3-integration-test)

To test the example endpoint, we want to:

- ensure it handles only GET requests
- ensure that it can be accessed only by superusers
- check if the response body is properly set

Below is a simple integration test for the above test cases. We'll also use the test data created in the
previous step.

`// main_test.go
package main
import (
    "net/http"
    "testing"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tests"
)
const testDataDir = "./test_pb_data"
func generateToken(collectionNameOrId string, email string) (string, error) {
    app, err := tests.NewTestApp(testDataDir)
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    defer app.Cleanup()
    record, err := app.FindAuthRecordByEmail(collectionNameOrId, email)
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    return record.NewAuthToken()
}
func TestHelloEndpoint(t *testing.T) {
    recordToken, err := generateToken("users", "test@example.com")
    if err != nil {
        t.Fatal(err)
    }
    superuserToken, err := generateToken(core.CollectionNameSuperusers, "test@example.com")
    if err != nil {
        t.Fatal(err)
    }
    // setup the test ApiScenario app instance
    setupTestApp := func(t testing.TB) *tests.TestApp {
        testApp, err := tests.NewTestApp(testDataDir)
        if err != nil {
            t.Fatal(err)
        }
        // no need to cleanup since scenario.Test() will do that for us
        // defer testApp.Cleanup()
        bindAppHooks(testApp)
        return testApp
    }
    scenarios := []tests.ApiScenario{
        {
            Name:            "try with different http method, e.g. POST",
            Method:          http.MethodPost,
            URL:             "/my/hello",
            ExpectedStatus:  405,
            ExpectedContent: []string{"\"data\":{}"},
            TestAppFactory:  setupTestApp,
        },
        {
            Name:            "try as guest (aka. no Authorization header)",
            Method:          http.MethodGet,
            URL:             "/my/hello",
            ExpectedStatus:  401,
            ExpectedContent: []string{"\"data\":{}"},
            TestAppFactory:  setupTestApp,
        },
        {
            Name:   "try as authenticated app user",
            Method: http.MethodGet,
            URL:    "/my/hello",
            Headers: map[string]string{
                "Authorization": recordToken,
            },
            ExpectedStatus:  401,
            ExpectedContent: []string{"\"data\":{}"},
            TestAppFactory:  setupTestApp,
        },
        {
            Name:   "try as authenticated superuser",
            Method: http.MethodGet,
            URL:    "/my/hello",
            Headers: map[string]string{
                "Authorization": superuserToken,
            },
            ExpectedStatus:  200,
            ExpectedContent: []string{"Hello world!"},
            TestAppFactory:  setupTestApp,
        },
    }
    for _, scenario := range scenarios {
        scenario.Test(t)

- [app.Store()](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-miscellaneous/#app-store)
- [Security helpers](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-miscellaneous/#security-helpers)
  - [Generating random strings](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-miscellaneous/#generating-random-strings)
  - [Compare strings with constant time](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-miscellaneous/#compare-strings-with-constant-time)
  - [AES Encrypt/Decrypt](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-miscellaneous/#aes-encryptdecrypt)

### [app.Store()](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-miscellaneous/\#app-store)

[`app.Store()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core#BaseApp.Store)
returns a concurrent-safe application memory store that you can use to store anything for the duration of the
application process (e.g. cache, config flags, etc.).

You can find more details about the available store methods in the
[`store.Store`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/store#Store)
documentation but the most commonly used ones are `Get(key)`, `Set(key, value)` and
`GetOrSet(key, setFunc)`.

`app.Store().Set("example", 123)
v1 := app.Store().Get("example").(int) // 123
v2 := app.Store().GetOrSet("example2", func() any {
    // this setter is invoked only once unless "example2" is removed
    // (e.g. suitable for instantiating singletons)
    return 456
}).(int) // 456`

Keep in mind that the application store is also used internally usually with `pb*`
prefixed keys (e.g. the collections cache is stored under the `pbAppCachedCollections`
key) and changing these system keys or calling `RemoveAll()`/ `Reset()` could
have unintended side-effects.

If you want more advanced control you can initialize your own store independent from the
application instance via
`store.New[K, T](nil)`.

### [Security helpers](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-miscellaneous/\#security-helpers)

_Below are listed some of the most commonly used security helpers but you can find detailed_
_documentation for all available methods in the_
_[`security`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/security)_
_subpackage._

##### [Generating random strings](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-miscellaneous/\#generating-random-strings)

`secret := security.RandomString(10) // e.g. a35Vdb10Z4
secret := security.RandomStringWithAlphabet(5, "1234567890") // e.g. 33215`

##### [Compare strings with constant time](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-miscellaneous/\#compare-strings-with-constant-time)

`isEqual := security.Equal(hash1, hash2)`

##### [AES Encrypt/Decrypt](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-miscellaneous/\#aes-encryptdecrypt)

`// must be random 32 characters string
const key = "C7aoNPItI2SATN2SSt7M0AATM8FWLqg5"
encrypted, err := security.Encrypt([]byte("test"), key)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
decrypted := security.Decrypt(encrypted, key) // []byte("test")`

## PocketBase Realtime Messaging
Realtime messaging

By default PocketBase sends realtime events only for Record create/update/delete operations ( _and for the OAuth2 auth redirect_), but you are free to send custom realtime messages to the connected clients via the
[`app.SubscriptionsBroker()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core#BaseApp.SubscriptionsBroker) instance.

[`app.SubscriptionsBroker().Clients()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/subscriptions#Broker.Clients)
returns all connected
[`subscriptions.Client`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/subscriptions#Client)
indexed by their unique connection id.

[`app.SubscriptionsBroker().ChunkedClients(size)`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/subscriptions#Broker.ChunkedClients)
is similar but return the result as a chunked slice allowing you to split the iteration across several goroutines
(usually combined with
[`errgroup`](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/sync/errgroup)
).

The current auth record associated with a client could be accessed through
`client.Get(apis.RealtimeClientAuthKey)`

Note that a single authenticated user could have more than one active realtime connection (aka.
multiple clients). This could happen for example when opening the same app in different tabs,
browsers, devices, etc.

Below you can find a minimal code sample that sends a JSON payload to all clients subscribed to the
"example" topic:

`func notify(app core.App, subscription string, data any) error {
    rawData, err := json.Marshal(data)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    message := subscriptions.Message{
        Name: subscription,
        Data: rawData,
    }
    group := new(errgroup.Group)
    chunks := app.SubscriptionsBroker().ChunkedClients(300)
    for _, chunk := range chunks {
        group.Go(func() error {
            for _, client := range chunk {
                if !client.HasSubscription(subscription) {
                    continue
                }
                client.Send(message)
            }
            return nil
        })
    }
    return group.Wait()
}
err := notify(app, "example", map[string]any{"test": 123})
if err != nil {
    return err
}`

From the client-side, users can listen to the custom subscription topic by doing something like:

JavaScript

Dart

`import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';
const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
...
await pb.realtime.subscribe('example', (e) => {
    console.log(e)
})`

`import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart';
final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
...
await pb.realtime.subscribe('example', (e) {
    print(e)
})`

## Using PocketBase APIs
How to use PocketBase

The easiest way to use PocketBase is by interacting with its Web APIs directly from the client-side (e.g.
mobile app or browser SPA).

It was designed with this exact use case in mind and it is also the reason why there are general purpose
JSON APIs for listing, pagination, sorting, filtering, etc.

The access and filter controls for your data is usually done through the
[collection API rules](https://pocketbase.io/docs/api-rules-and-filters/)
.

For the cases when you need more specialized handling (sending emails, intercepting the default actions,
creating new routes, etc.) you can
[extend PocketBase with Go or JavaScript](https://pocketbase.io/docs/use-as-framework/)
.

For interacting with the
[Web APIs](https://pocketbase.io/docs/api-records/)
you can make use of the official SDK clients:

- [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/pocketbase/js-sdk)(Browser, Node.js, React Native)
- [Dart SDK](https://github.com/pocketbase/dart-sdk)(Web, Mobile, Desktop, CLI)

When used on the client-side, it is safe to have a single/global SDK instance for the entire lifecycle of
your application.

**[Web apps recommendation](https://pocketbase.io/docs/how-to-use/#web-apps-recommendation)**

Not everyone will agree with this, but if you are building a web app with PocketBase I recommend
developing the frontend as a **traditional client-side SPA** and for the cases where additional
server-side handling is needed (e.g. for payment webhooks, extra data server validations, etc.) you
could try to:

- [Use PocketBase as Go/JS framework](https://pocketbase.io/docs/use-as-framework) to create new routes or
intercept existing.
- Create one-off Node.js/Bun/Deno/etc. server-side actions that will interact with
PocketBase only as superuser and as pure data store (similar to traditional database
interactions but over HTTP). In this case it is safe to have a global superuser client
such as:

`// src/superuser.js
import PocketBase from "pocketbase"
const superuserClient = new PocketBase('https://example.com');
// disable autocancellation so that we can handle async requests from multiple users
superuserClient.autoCancellation(false);
// option 1: authenticate as superuser using email/password (could be filled with ENV params)
await superuserClient.collection('_superusers').authWithPassword(SUPERUSER_EMAIL, SUPERUSER_PASS, {
    // This will trigger auto refresh or auto reauthentication in case
    // the token has expired or is going to expire in the next 30 minutes.
    autoRefreshThreshold: 30 * 60
})
// option 2: OR authenticate as superuser via long-lived "API key"
// (see https://pocketbase.io/docs/authentication/#api-keys)
superuserClient.authStore.save('YOUR_GENERATED_SUPERUSER_TOKEN')
export default superuserClient;`

Then you can import directly the file in your server-side actions and use the client as
usual:

`import superuserClient from './src/superuser.js'
async function serverAction(req, resp) {
    ... do some extra data validations or handling ...
    // send a create request as superuser
    await superuserClient.collection('example').create({ ... })
}`


**[Why not JS SSR](https://pocketbase.io/docs/how-to-use/#why-not-js-ssr)**

Using PocketBase with meta framework such as SvelteKit, Nuxt, Next.js, etc.
**in a JS SSR mode**
is possible but it comes with many complications and you need to carefully evaluate whether the cost
of having another backend (PocketBase) along-side your existing one (the Node.js server) is worth it.

You can read more about the potential problems in
[JS SSR - issues and recommendations #5313](https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/discussions/5313) but some of the common pitfalls are:

- Security issues caused by incorrectly initialized and shared JS SDK instance in a long-running
server-side context.
- OAuth2 integration difficulties related to the server-side only OAuth2 flow (or its mixed
"all-in-one" client-side handling and sharing a cookie with the server-side).
- Proxying realtime connections and essentially duplicating the same thing PocketBase already
does.
- Performance bottlenecks caused by the default single-threaded Node.js process and the
excessive resources utilization due to the server-side rendering and heavy back-and-forth
requests communication between the different layers (client<->Node.js<->PocketBase).

This doesn't mean that using PocketBase with JS SSR is always a "bad thing" but based on the
dozens reported issues so far I would recommend it only after careful evaluation and only to more
experienced developers that have in-depth understanding of the used tools and their trade-offs. If
you still want to use PocketBase to handle regular users authentication with a JS SSR meta
framework, then you can find some JS SDK examples in the repo's
[JS SSR integration section](https://github.com/pocketbase/js-sdk#ssr-integration).

**[Why not htmx, Hotwire/Turbo, Unpoly, etc.](https://pocketbase.io/docs/how-to-use/#why-not-htmx-hotwireturbo-unpoly-etc-)**

htmx, Hotwire/Turbo, Unpoly and other similar tools are commonly used for building server rendered
applications but unfortunately they don't play well with the JSON APIs and fully stateless nature
of PocketBase.

It is possible to use them with PocketBase but at the moment I don't recommend it because we lack
the necessary helpers and utilities for building SSR-first applications, which means that you
might have to create from scratch a lot of things on your own such as middlewares for handling
cookies ( _and eventually taking care also for CORS and CSRF_) or custom authentication
endpoints and access controls ( _the collection API rules apply only for the builtin JSON routes_).

In the future we could eventually provide official SSR support in terms of guides and middlewares
for this use case but again - PocketBase wasn't designed with this in mind and you may want to
reevaluate the tech stack of your application and switch to a traditional client-side SPA as
mentioned earlier or use a different backend solution that might fit better with your use case.

**[Mobile apps auth persistence](https://pocketbase.io/docs/how-to-use/#mobile-apps-auth-persistence)**

When building mobile apps with the JavaScript SDK or Dart SDK you'll have to specify a custom
persistence store if you want to preserve the authentication between the various app activities
and open/close state.

The SDKs comes with a helper async storage implementation that allows you to hook any custom
persistent layer (local file, SharedPreferences, key-value based database, etc.). Here is a
minimal PocketBase SDKs initialization for React Native (JavaScript) and Flutter (Dart):

JavaScript

Dart

`// Node.js and React Native doesn't have native EventSource implementation
// so in order to use the realtime subscriptions you'll need to load EventSource polyfill,
// for example: npm install react-native-sse --save
import eventsource from 'react-native-sse';
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';
import PocketBase, { AsyncAuthStore } from 'pocketbase';
// load the polyfill
global.EventSource = eventsource;
// initialize the async store
const store = new AsyncAuthStore({
    save:    async (serialized) => AsyncStorage.setItem('pb_auth', serialized),
    initial: AsyncStorage.getItem('pb_auth'),
});
// initialize the PocketBase client
// (it is OK to have a single/global instance for the duration of your application)
const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090', store);
...
await pb.collection('users').authWithPassword('test@example.com', '1234567890');
console.log(pb.authStore.record)`

`import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart';
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';
// for simplicity we are using a simple SharedPreferences instance
// but you can also replace it with its safer EncryptedSharedPreferences alternative
final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
// initialize the async store
final store = AsyncAuthStore(
save:    (String data) async => prefs.setString('pb_auth', data),
initial: prefs.getString('pb_auth'),
);
// initialize the PocketBase client
// (it is OK to have a single/global instance for the duration of your application)
final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090', authStore: store);
...
await pb.collection('users').authWithPassword('test@example.com', '1234567890');
print(pb.authStore.record);`

**[React Native file upload on Android and iOS](https://pocketbase.io/docs/how-to-use/#react-native-file-upload-on-android-and-ios)**

At the time of writing, React Native on Android and iOS seems to have a non-standard
`FormData` implementation and for uploading files on these platforms it requires the following
special object syntax:

`{
uri: "...",
type: "...",
name: "..."
}`

Or in other words, you may have to apply a conditional handling similar to:

`const data = new FormData();
// result is the resolved promise of ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync
let imageUri = result.assets[0].uri;
if (Platform.OS === 'web') {
const req = await fetch(imageUri);
const blob = await req.blob();
data.append('avatar', blob); // regular File/Blob value
} else {
// the below object format works only on Android and iOS
// (FormData.set() also doesn't seem to be supported so we use FormData.append())
data.append('avatar', {
    uri:  imageUri,
    type: 'image/*',
    name: imageUri.split('/').pop(),
});
}
...
await pb.collection('example').create(data)`

The next couple pages have a little bit more information about the basic PocketBase components like
collections, records, authentication, relations, files handling, etc.

## PocketBase Event Hooks
Event hooks

You can extend the default PocketBase behavior with custom server-side code using the exposed JavaScript
app event hooks.

Throwing an error or not calling `e.next()` inside a handler function stops the hook execution chain.

All hook handler functions share the same `function(e){}` signature and expect the
user to call `e.next()` if they want to proceed with the execution chain.

- [App hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#app-hooks)
- [Mailer hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#mailer-hooks)
- [Realtime hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#realtime-hooks)
- [Record model hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#record-model-hooks)
- [Collection model hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#collection-model-hooks)
- [Request hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#request-hooks)
- [Base model hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#base-model-hooks)

### [App hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/\#app-hooks)

**[onBootstrap](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#onbootstrap)**

`onBootstrap` hook is triggered when initializing the main
application resources (db, app settings, etc).


Note that attempting to access the database before the `e.next()` call will result in an error.

`onBootstrap((e) => {
    e.next()
    // e.app
})`

**[onSettingsReload](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#onsettingsreload)**

`onSettingsReload` hook is triggered every time when the `$app.settings()`
is being replaced with a new state.


Calling `e.app.settings()` after `e.next()` returns the new state.


`onSettingsReload((e) => {
    e.next()
    // e.app.settings()
})`

**[onBackupCreate](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#onbackupcreate)**

`onBackupCreate` is triggered on each `$app.createBackup` call.


`onBackupCreate((e) => {
    // e.app
    // e.name    - the name of the backup to create
    // e.exclude - list of pb_data dir entries to exclude from the backup
})`

**[onBackupRestore](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#onbackuprestore)**

`onBackupRestore` is triggered before app backup restore (aka. on `$app.restoreBackup` call).


`onBackupRestore((e) => {
    // e.app
    // e.name    - the name of the backup to restore
    // e.exclude - list of dir entries to exclude from the backup
})`

**[onTerminate](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#onterminate)**

`onTerminate` hook is triggered when the app is in the process
of being terminated (ex. on `SIGTERM` signal).


Note that the app could be terminated abruptly without awaiting the hook completion.


`onTerminate((e) => {
    // e.app
    // e.isRestart
})`

### [Mailer hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/\#mailer-hooks)

**[onMailerSend](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#onmailersend)**

`onMailerSend` hook is triggered every time when a new email is
being send using the `$app.newMailClient()` instance.


It allows intercepting the email message or to use a custom mailer client.

`onMailerSend((e) => {
    // e.app
    // e.mailer
    // e.message
    // ex. change the mail subject
    e.message.subject = "new subject"
    e.next()
})`

**[onMailerRecordAuthAlertSend](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#onmailerrecordauthalertsend)**

`onMailerRecordAuthAlertSend` hook is triggered when
sending a new device login auth alert email, allowing you to
intercept and customize the email message that is being sent.


`onMailerRecordAuthAlertSend((e) => {
    // e.app
    // e.mailer
    // e.message
    // e.record
    // e.meta
    // ex. change the mail subject
    e.message.subject = "new subject"
    e.next()
})`

**[onMailerRecordPasswordResetSend](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#onmailerrecordpasswordresetsend)**

`onMailerRecordPasswordResetSend` hook is triggered when
sending a password reset email to an auth record, allowing
you to intercept and customize the email message that is being sent.


`onMailerRecordPasswordResetSend((e) => {
    // e.app
    // e.mailer
    // e.message
    // e.record
    // e.meta
    // ex. change the mail subject
    e.message.subject = "new subject"
    e.next()
})`

**[onMailerRecordVerificationSend](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#onmailerrecordverificationsend)**

`onMailerRecordVerificationSend` hook is triggered when
sending a verification email to an auth record, allowing
you to intercept and customize the email message that is being sent.


`onMailerRecordVerificationSend((e) => {
    // e.app
    // e.mailer
    // e.message
    // e.record
    // e.meta
    // ex. change the mail subject
    e.message.subject = "new subject"
    e.next()
})`

**[onMailerRecordEmailChangeSend](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#onmailerrecordemailchangesend)**

`onMailerRecordEmailChangeSend` hook is triggered when sending a
confirmation new address email to an auth record, allowing
you to intercept and customize the email message that is being sent.


`onMailerRecordEmailChangeSend((e) => {
    // e.app
    // e.mailer
    // e.message
    // e.record
    // e.meta
    // ex. change the mail subject
    e.message.subject = "new subject"
    e.next()
})`

**[onMailerRecordOTPSend](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#onmailerrecordotpsend)**

`onMailerRecordOTPSend` hook is triggered when sending an OTP email
to an auth record, allowing you to intercept and customize the
email message that is being sent.


`onMailerRecordOTPSend((e) => {
    // e.app
    // e.mailer
    // e.message
    // e.record
    // e.meta
    // ex. change the mail subject
    e.message.subject = "new subject"
    e.next()
})`

### [Realtime hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/\#realtime-hooks)

**[onRealtimeConnectRequest](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#onrealtimeconnectrequest)**

`onRealtimeConnectRequest` hook is triggered when establishing the SSE client connection.


Any execution after e.next() of a hook handler happens after the client disconnects.


`onRealtimeConnectRequest((e) => {
    // e.app
    // e.client
    // e.idleTimeout
    // and all RequestEvent fields...
    e.next()
})`

**[onRealtimeSubscribeRequest](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#onrealtimesubscriberequest)**

`onRealtimeSubscribeRequest` hook is triggered when updating the
client subscriptions, allowing you to further validate and
modify the submitted change.


`OnRealtimeSubscribeRequest((e) => {
    // e.app
    // e.client
    // e.subscriptions
    // and all RequestEvent fields...
    e.next()
})`

### [Record model hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/\#record-model-hooks)

These are lower level Record model hooks and could be triggered from anywhere (custom console command, scheduled cron job, when calling `e.save(record)`, etc.) and therefore they have no access to the request context!

If you want to intercept the builtin Web APIs and to access their request body, query parameters, headers or the request auth state, then please use the designated
[Record `*Request` hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#request-hooks)
.

**[onRecordEnrich](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#onrecordenrich)**

`onRecordEnrich` is triggered every time when a record is enriched
\- as part of the builtin Record responses, during realtime message serialization, or when `apis.enrichRecord` is invoked.


It could be used for example to redact/hide or add computed temporary
Record model props only for the specific request info.


`onRecordEnrich((e) => {
    // hide one or more fields
    e.record.hide("role")
    // add new custom field for registered users
    if (e.requestInfo.auth?.collection()?.name == "users") {
        e.record.withCustomData(true) // for security custom props require to be enabled explicitly
        e.record.set("computedScore", e.record.get("score") * e.requestInfo.auth.get("base"))
    }
    e.next()
}, "posts")`

**[onRecordValidate](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#onrecordvalidate)**

`onRecordValidate` is a Record proxy model hook of `onModelValidate`.


`onRecordValidate` is called every time when a Record is being validated,
e.g. triggered by `$app.validate()` or `$app.save()`.


`// fires for every record
onRecordValidate((e) => {
    // e.app
    // e.record
    e.next()
})
// fires only for "users" and "articles" records
onRecordValidate((e) => {
    // e.app
    // e.record
    e.next()
}, "users", "articles")`

###### [Record model create hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/\#record-model-create-hooks)

**[onRecordCreate](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#onrecordcreate)**

`onRecordCreate` is a Record proxy model hook of `onModelCreate`.


`onRecordCreate` is triggered every time when a new Record is being created,
e.g. triggered by `$app.save()`.


Operations BEFORE the `e.next()` execute before the Record validation
and the INSERT DB statement.


Operations AFTER the `e.next()` execute after the Record validation
and the INSERT DB statement.


Note that successful execution doesn't guarantee that the Record
is persisted in the database since its wrapping transaction may
not have been committed yet.
If you want to listen to only the actual persisted events, you can
bind to `onRecordAfterCreateSuccess` or `onRecordAfterCreateError` hooks.


`// fires for every record
onRecordCreate((e) => {
    // e.app
    // e.record
    e.next()

and right before the model INSERT DB statement execution.


Usually it is triggered as part of the `$app.save()` in the following firing order:


`onRecordCreate`

 -\> `onRecordValidate` (skipped with `$app.saveNoValidate()`)


 -\> `onRecordCreateExecute`

Note that successful execution doesn't guarantee that the Record
is persisted in the database since its wrapping transaction may

depending on the error:


- **immediate** on `$app.save()` failure
- **delayed** on transaction rollback

`// fires for every record
onRecordAfterCreateError((e) => {
    // e.app
    // e.record
    // e.error

### [Base model hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/\#base-model-hooks)

The Model hooks are fired for all PocketBase structs that implements the Model DB interface - Record, Collection, Log, etc.

For convenience, if you want to listen to only the Record or Collection DB model
events without doing manual type assertion, you can use the
[`onRecord*`](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#record-model-hooks)
and
[`onCollection*`](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#collection-model-hooks)
proxy hooks above.


**[onModelValidate](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#onmodelvalidate)**

`onModelValidate` is called every time when a Model is being validated,
e.g. triggered by `$app.validate()` or `$app.save()`.


For convenience, if you want to listen to only the Record or Collection models
events without doing manual type assertion, you can use the equivalent `onRecord*` and `onCollection*` proxy hooks.


`// fires for every model
onModelValidate((e) => {
    // e.app
    // e.model
    e.next()
})
// fires only for "users" and "articles" models
onModelValidate((e) => {
    // e.app
    // e.model
    e.next()
}, "users", "articles")`

###### [Base model create hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/\#base-model-create-hooks)

**[onModelCreate](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#onmodelcreate)**

`onModelCreate` is triggered every time when a new Model is being created,
e.g. triggered by `$app.save()`.


Operations BEFORE the `e.next()` execute before the Model validation
and the INSERT DB statement.


Operations AFTER the `e.next()` execute after the Model validation
and the INSERT DB statement.


Note that successful execution doesn't guarantee that the Model
is persisted in the database since its wrapping transaction may
not have been committed yet.
If you want to listen to only the actual persisted events, you can
bind to `onModelAfterCreateSuccess` or `onModelAfterCreateError` hooks.


For convenience, if you want to listen to only the Record or Collection models
events without doing manual type assertion, you can use the equivalent `onRecord*` and `onCollection*` proxy hooks.


`// fires for every model
onModelCreate((e) => {
    // e.app
    // e.model
    e.next()
})
// fires only for "users" and "articles" models
onModelCreate((e) => {
    // e.app
    // e.model
    e.next()
}, "users", "articles")`

**[onModelCreateExecute](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#onmodelcreateexecute)**

`onModelCreateExecute` is triggered after successful Model validation
and right before the model INSERT DB statement execution.


Usually it is triggered as part of the `$app.save()` in the following firing order:


`onModelCreate`

 -\> `onModelValidate` (skipped with `$app.saveNoValidate()`)


 -\> `onModelCreateExecute`

Note that successful execution doesn't guarantee that the Model
is persisted in the database since its wrapping transaction may
not have been committed yet.
If you want to listen to only the actual persisted events, you can
bind to `onModelAfterCreateSuccess` or `onModelAfterCreateError` hooks.


For convenience, if you want to listen to only the Record or Collection models
events without doing manual type assertion, you can use the equivalent `onRecord*` and `onCollection*` proxy hooks.


`// fires for every model
onModelCreateExecute((e) => {
    // e.app
    // e.model
    e.next()
})
// fires only for "users" and "articles" models
onModelCreateExecute((e) => {
    // e.app
    // e.model
    e.next()
}, "users", "articles")`

**[onModelAfterCreateSuccess](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#onmodelaftercreatesuccess)**

`onModelAfterCreateSuccess` is triggered after each successful
Model DB create persistence.


Note that when a Model is persisted as part of a transaction,
this hook is delayed and executed only AFTER the transaction has been committed.
This hook is NOT triggered in case the transaction fails/rollbacks.


For convenience, if you want to listen to only the Record or Collection models
events without doing manual type assertion, you can use the equivalent `onRecord*` and `onCollection*` proxy hooks.


`// fires for every model
onModelAfterCreateSuccess((e) => {
    // e.app
    // e.model
    e.next()
})
// fires only for "users" and "articles" models
onModelAfterCreateSuccess((e) => {
    // e.app
    // e.model
    e.next()
}, "users", "articles")`

**[onModelAfterCreateError](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#onmodelaftercreateerror)**

`onModelAfterCreateError` is triggered after each failed
Model DB create persistence.


Note that the execution of this hook is either immediate or delayed
depending on the error:


- **immediate** on `$app.save()` failure
- **delayed** on transaction rollback

For convenience, if you want to listen to only the Record or Collection models
events without doing manual type assertion, you can use the equivalent `onRecord*` and `onCollection*` proxy hooks.


`// fires for every model
onModelAfterCreateError((e) => {
    // e.app
    // e.model
    // e.error
    e.next()
})
// fires only for "users" and "articles" models
onModelAfterCreateError((e) => {
    // e.app
    // e.model
    // e.error
    e.next()
}, "users", "articles")`

###### [Base model update hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/\#base-model-update-hooks)

**[onModelUpdate](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#onmodelupdate)**

`onModelUpdate` is triggered every time when a new Model is being updated,
e.g. triggered by `$app.save()`.


Operations BEFORE the `e.next()` execute before the Model validation
and the UPDATE DB statement.


Operations AFTER the `e.next()` execute after the Model validation
and the UPDATE DB statement.


Note that successful execution doesn't guarantee that the Model
is persisted in the database since its wrapping transaction may
not have been committed yet.
If you want to listen to only the actual persisted events, you can
bind to `onModelAfterUpdateSuccess` or `onModelAfterUpdateError` hooks.


For convenience, if you want to listen to only the Record or Collection models
events without doing manual type assertion, you can use the equivalent `onRecord*` and `onCollection*` proxy hooks.


`// fires for every model
onModelUpdate((e) => {
    // e.app
    // e.model
    e.next()
})
// fires only for "users" and "articles" models

    // e.app
    // e.model
    e.next()
}, "users", "articles")`

**[onModelUpdateExecute](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#onmodelupdateexecute)**

`onModelUpdateExecute` is triggered after successful Model validation
and right before the model UPDATE DB statement execution.


Usually it is triggered as part of the `$app.save()` in the following firing order:


`onModelUpdate`

 -\> `onModelValidate` (skipped with `$app.saveNoValidate()`)


 -\> `onModelUpdateExecute`

Note that successful execution doesn't guarantee that the Model
is persisted in the database since its wrapping transaction may
not have been committed yet.
If you want to listen to only the actual persisted events, you can
bind to `onModelAfterUpdateSuccess` or `onModelAfterUpdateError` hooks.


For convenience, if you want to listen to only the Record or Collection models
events without doing manual type assertion, you can use the equivalent `onRecord*` and `onCollection*` proxy hooks.


`// fires for every model
onModelUpdateExecute((e) => {
    // e.app
    // e.model
    e.next()
})
// fires only for "users" and "articles" models
onModelUpdateExecute((e) => {
    // e.app
    // e.model
    e.next()
}, "users", "articles")`

**[onModelAfterUpdateSuccess](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#onmodelafterupdatesuccess)**

`onModelAfterUpdateSuccess` is triggered after each successful
Model DB update persistence.


Note that when a Model is persisted as part of a transaction,
this hook is delayed and executed only AFTER the transaction has been committed.
This hook is NOT triggered in case the transaction fails/rollbacks.


For convenience, if you want to listen to only the Record or Collection models
events without doing manual type assertion, you can use the equivalent `onRecord*` and `onCollection*` proxy hooks.


`// fires for every model
onModelAfterUpdateSuccess((e) => {
    // e.app
    // e.model
    e.next()
})
// fires only for "users" and "articles" models
onModelAfterUpdateSuccess((e) => {
    // e.app
    // e.model
    e.next()
}, "users", "articles")`

**[onModelAfterUpdateError](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#onmodelafterupdateerror)**

`onModelAfterUpdateError` is triggered after each failed
Model DB update persistence.


Note that the execution of this hook is either immediate or delayed
depending on the error:


- **immediate** on `$app.save()` failure
- **delayed** on transaction rollback

For convenience, if you want to listen to only the Record or Collection models
events without doing manual type assertion, you can use the equivalent `onRecord*` and `onCollection*` proxy hooks.


`// fires for every model
onModelAfterUpdateError((e) => {
    // e.app
    // e.model
    // e.error
    e.next()
})
// fires only for "users" and "articles" models
onModelAfterUpdateError((e) => {
    // e.app
    // e.model
    // e.error
    e.next()
}, "users", "articles")`

###### [Base model delete hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/\#base-model-delete-hooks)

**[onModelDelete](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#onmodeldelete)**

`onModelDelete` is triggered every time when a new Model is being deleted,
e.g. triggered by `$app.delete()`.


Operations BEFORE the `e.next()` execute before the Model validation
and the UPDATE DB statement.


Operations AFTER the `e.next()` execute after the Model validation
and the UPDATE DB statement.


Note that successful execution doesn't guarantee that the Model
is deleted from the database since its wrapping transaction may
not have been committed yet.
If you want to listen to only the actual persisted deleted events, you can
bind to `onModelAfterDeleteSuccess` or `onModelAfterDeleteError` hooks.


For convenience, if you want to listen to only the Record or Collection models
events without doing manual type assertion, you can use the equivalent `onRecord*` and `onCollection*` proxy hooks.


`// fires for every model
onModelDelete((e) => {
    // e.app
    // e.model
    e.next()
})
// fires only for "users" and "articles" models
onModelDelete((e) => {
    // e.app
    // e.model
    e.next()
}, "users", "articles")`

**[onModelDeleteExecute](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#onmodeldeleteexecute)**

`onModelDeleteExecute` is triggered after the internal delete checks and
right before the Model the model DELETE DB statement execution.


Usually it is triggered as part of the `$app.delete()` in the following firing order:


`onModelDelete`

 -\>
internal delete checks


 -\> `onModelDeleteExecute`

Note that successful execution doesn't guarantee that the Model

[Prev: Overview](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-overview) [Next: Routing](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-routing)

## Extending PocketBase
Extending PocketBase

One of the main feature of PocketBase is that
**it can be used as a framework** which enables you to write your own custom app business
logic in
[Go](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-overview) or [JavaScript](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-overview) and still have a portable
backend at the end.

**Choose [Extend with Go](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-overview) if you are already familiar**
**with the language or have the time to learn it.**
As the primary PocketBase language, the Go APIs are better documented and you'll be able to integrate with
any 3rd party Go library since you'll have more control over the application flow. The only drawback is that
the Go APIs are slightly more verbose and it may require some time to get used to, especially if this is your
first time working with Go.

**Choose [Extend with JavaScript](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-overview)**
**if you don't intend to write too much custom code and want a quick way to explore the PocketBase capabilities.**
The embedded JavaScript engine is a pluggable wrapper around the existing Go APIs, so most of the time the
slight performance penalty will be negligible because it'll invoke the Go functions under the hood.


As a bonus, because the JS VM mirrors the Go APIs, you would be able migrate gradually without much code changes
from JS -> Go at later stage in case you hit a bottleneck or want more control over the execution flow.

With both Go and JavaScript, you can:

- **Register custom routes:**



Go

JavaScript








`app.OnServe().BindFunc(func(se *core.ServeEvent) error {
      se.Router.GET("/hello", func(e *core.RequestEvent) error {
          return e.String(http.StatusOK, "Hello world!")
      })
      return se.Next()
})`







`routerAdd("GET", "/hello", (e) => {
      return e.string(200, "Hello world!")
})`

- **Bind to event hooks and intercept responses:**



Go

JavaScript








`app.OnRecordCreateRequest("posts").BindFunc(func(e *core.RecordRequestEvent) error {
      // if not superuser, overwrite the newly submitted "posts" record status to pending
      if !e.HasSuperuserAuth() {
          e.Record.Set("status", "pending")
      }
      return e.Next()
})`







`onRecordCreateRequest((e) => {
      // if not superuser, overwrite the newly submitted "posts" record status to pending
      if (!e.hasSuperuserAuth()) {
          e.record.set("status", "pending")
      }
      e.next()
}, "posts")`

- **Register custom console commands:**



Go

JavaScript








`app.RootCmd.AddCommand(&cobra.Command{
      Use: "hello",
      Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
          print("Hello world!")
      },
})`







`$app.rootCmd.addCommand(new Command({
      use: "hello",
      run: (cmd, args) => {
          console.log("Hello world!")
      },
}))`

- and many more...

### [Deployment strategies](https://pocketbase.io/docs/going-to-production/\#deployment-strategies)

##### [Minimal setup](https://pocketbase.io/docs/going-to-production/\#minimal-setup)

One of the best PocketBase features is that it's completely portable. This mean that it doesn't require
any external dependency and
**could be deployed by just uploading the executable on your server**.

Here is an example for starting a production HTTPS server (auto managed TLS with Let's Encrypt) on clean
Ubuntu 22.04 installation.

1. Consider the following app directory structure:

`myapp/
       pb_migrations/
       pb_hooks/
       pocketbase`

2. Upload the binary and anything else required by your application to your remote server, for
    example using
    **rsync**:

`rsync -avz -e ssh /local/path/to/myapp root@YOUR_SERVER_IP:/root/pb`

3. Start a SSH session with your server:

`ssh root@YOUR_SERVER_IP`

4. Start the executable (specifying a domain name will issue a Let's encrypt certificate for it)

`[root@dev ~]$ /root/pb/pocketbase serve yourdomain.com`


> Notice that in the above example we are logged in as **root** which allow us to
> bind to the
> **privileged 80 and 443 ports**.
>
>
> For **non-root** users usually you'll need special privileges to be able to do
> that. You have several options depending on your OS - `authbind`,
> `setcap`,
> `iptables`, `sysctl`, etc. Here is an example using `setcap`:
>
> `[myuser@dev ~]$ sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /root/pb/pocketbase`

5. (Optional) Systemd service

You can skip step 3 and create a **Systemd service**
    to allow your application to start/restart on its own.



    Here is an example service file (usually created in
    `/lib/systemd/system/pocketbase.service`):

`[Unit]
Description = pocketbase
[Service]
Type             = simple
User             = root
Group            = root
LimitNOFILE      = 4096
Restart          = always
RestartSec       = 5s
StandardOutput   = append:/root/pb/std.log
StandardError    = append:/root/pb/std.log
WorkingDirectory = /root/pb
ExecStart        = /root/pb/pocketbase serve yourdomain.com
[Install]
WantedBy = multi-user.target`

After that we just have to enable it and start the service using `systemctl`:

`[root@dev ~]$ systemctl enable pocketbase.service
[root@dev ~]$ systemctl start pocketbase`


> You can find a link to the Web UI installer in the `/root/pb/std.log`, but
> alternatively you can also create the first superuser explicitly via the
> `superuser` PocketBase command:
>
> `[root@dev ~]$ /root/pb/pocketbase superuser create EMAIL PASS`


##### [Using reverse proxy](https://pocketbase.io/docs/going-to-production/\#using-reverse-proxy)

If you plan hosting multiple applications on a single server or need finer network controls, you can
always put PocketBase behind a reverse proxy such as
_NGINX_, _Apache_, _Caddy_, etc.


_Just note that when using a reverse proxy you may need to setup the "User IP proxy headers" in the_
_PocketBase settings so that the application can extract and log the actual visitor/client IP (the_
_headers are usually `X-Real-IP`, `X-Forwarded-For`)._

Here is a minimal _NGINX_ example configuration:

`server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    client_max_body_size 10M;
    location / {
        # check http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html#keepalive
        proxy_set_header Connection '';
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_read_timeout 360s;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        # enable if you are serving under a subpath location
        # rewrite /yourSubpath/(.*) /$1  break;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8090;
    }
}`

Corresponding _Caddy_ configuration is:

`example.com {
    request_body {
        max_size 10MB
    }
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8090 {
        transport http {
            read_timeout 360s
        }
    }
}`

##### [Using Docker](https://pocketbase.io/docs/going-to-production/\#using-docker)

Some hosts (e.g. [fly.io](https://fly.io/)) use Docker
for deployments. PocketBase doesn't have an official Docker image, but you could use the below minimal
Dockerfile as an example:

`FROM alpine:latest
ARG PB_VERSION=0.26.6
RUN apk add --no-cache \
    unzip \
    ca-certificates
# download and unzip PocketBase
ADD https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/releases/download/v${PB_VERSION}/pocketbase_${PB_VERSION}_linux_amd64.zip /tmp/pb.zip
RUN unzip /tmp/pb.zip -d /pb/
# uncomment to copy the local pb_migrations dir into the image
# COPY ./pb_migrations /pb/pb_migrations
# uncomment to copy the local pb_hooks dir into the image
# COPY ./pb_hooks /pb/pb_hooks
EXPOSE 8080
# start PocketBase
CMD ["/pb/pocketbase", "serve", "--http=0.0.0.0:8080"]`

To persist your data you need to mount a volume at `/pb/pb_data`.

_For a full example you could check the_
_["Host for free on Fly.io"](https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/discussions/537)_
_guide._

### [Backup and Restore](https://pocketbase.io/docs/going-to-production/\#backup-and-restore)

To backup/restore your application it is enough to manually copy/replace your `pb_data`
directory
_(for transactional safety make sure that the application is not running)_.

To make things slightly easier, PocketBase v0.16+ comes with built-in backups and restore APIs that could
be accessed from the Dashboard (
_Settings_ \> _Backups_
):

![Backups settings screenshot](https://pocketbase.io/images/screenshots/backups.png)

Backups can be stored locally (default) or in a S3 compatible storage ( _it is recommended to use a separate bucket only for the backups_). The generated backup represents a full snapshot as ZIP archive of your `pb_data` directory (including
the locally stored uploaded files but excluding any local backups or files uploaded to S3).

During the backup's ZIP generation the application will be temporary set in read-only mode.

Depending on the size of your `pb_data` this could be a very slow operation and it is
advised in case of large `pb_data` (e.g. 2GB+) to consider a different backup strategy
_(see an example_
_[backup.sh script](https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/discussions/4254#backups)_
_that combines `sqlite3 .backup` \+ `rsync`)_.

### [Recommendations](https://pocketbase.io/docs/going-to-production/\#recommendations)

By default, PocketBase uses the internal Unix `sendmail` command for sending emails.


While it's OK for development, it's not very useful for production, because your emails most likely will get
marked as spam or even fail to deliver.

To avoid deliverability issues, consider using a local SMTP server or an external mail service like
[MailerSend](https://www.mailersend.com/),
[Brevo](https://www.brevo.com/),
[SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/),
[Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/),
[AWS SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/), etc.

Once you've decided on a mail service, you could configure the PocketBase SMTP settings from the
_Dashboard > Settings > Mail settings_:

![SMTP settings screenshot](https://pocketbase.io/images/screenshots/smtp-settings.png)

As an additional layer of security you can enable the MFA and OTP options for the `_superusers`
collection, which will enforce an additional one-time password (email code) requirement when authenticating
as superuser.

In case of email deliverability issues, you can also generate an OTP manually using the
`./pocketbase superuser otp yoursuperuser@example.com` command.

![Superusers MFA settings screenshot](https://pocketbase.io/images/screenshots/superusers_mfa.png)

To minimize the risk of API abuse (e.g. excessive auth or record create requests) it is recommended to
setup a rate limiter.

PocketBase v0.23.0+ comes with a simple builtin rate limiter that should cover most of the cases but you
are also free to use any external one via reverse proxy if you need more advanced options.

You can configure the builtin rate limiter from the
_Dashboard > Settings > Application:_

![Rate limit settings screenshot](https://pocketbase.io/images/screenshots/rate-limit-settings.png)

The below instructions are for Linux but other operating systems have similar mechanism.

Unix uses _"file descriptors"_ also for network connections and most systems have a default limit
of ~ 1024.


If your application has a lot of concurrent realtime connections, it is possible that at some point you would
get an error such as: `Too many open files`.

One way to mitigate this is to check your current account resource limits by running
`ulimit -a` and find the parameter you want to change. For example, if you want to increase the
open files limit ( _-n_), you could run
`ulimit -n 4096` before starting PocketBase.

If you are running in a memory constrained environment, defining the
[`GOMEMLIMIT`](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime#hdr-Environment_Variables)
environment variable could help preventing out-of-memory (OOM) termination of your process. It is a "soft limit"
meaning that the memory usage could still exceed it in some situations, but it instructs the GC to be more
"aggressive" and run more often if needed. For example: `GOMEMLIMIT=512MiB`.

If after `GOMEMLIMIT` you are still experiencing OOM errors, you can try to enable swap
partitioning (if not already) or open a
[Q&A discussion](https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/discussions)
with some steps to reproduce the error in case it is something that we can improve in PocketBase.

It is fine to ignore the below if you are not sure whether you need it.

By default, PocketBase stores the applications settings in the database as plain JSON text, including the
SMTP password and S3 storage credentials.

While this is not a security issue on its own (PocketBase applications live entirely on a single server
and its expected only authorized users to have access to your server and application data), in some
situations it may be a good idea to store the settings encrypted in case someone get their hands on your
database file (e.g. from an external stored backup).

To store your PocketBase settings encrypted:

1. Create a new environment variable and **set a random 32 characters** string as its value.


e.g. add
    `export PB_ENCRYPTION_KEY="3kh4kb9G2CESdRvCnAJx1z5LcpbAoaAl"`
    in your shell profile file
2. Start the application with `--encryptionEnv=YOUR_ENV_VAR` flag.


e.g. `pocketbase serve --encryptionEnv=PB_ENCRYPTION_KEY`

## Go HTML Templates
Rendering templates

- [Overview](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-rendering-templates/#overview)
- [Example HTML page with layout](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-rendering-templates/#example-html-page-with-layout)

### [Overview](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-rendering-templates/\#overview)

A common task when creating custom routes or emails is the need of generating HTML output.

There are plenty of Go template-engines available that you can use for this, but often for simple cases
the Go standard library `html/template` package should work just fine.

To make it slightly easier to load template files concurrently and on the fly, PocketBase also provides a
thin wrapper around the standard library in the
[`github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/template`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/template)
utility package.

`import "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/template"
data := map[string]any{"name": "John"}
html, err := template.NewRegistry().LoadFiles(
    "views/base.html",
    "views/partial1.html",
    "views/partial2.html",
).Render(data)`

The general flow when working with composed and nested templates is that you create "base" template(s)
that defines various placeholders using the
`{{template "placeholderName" .}}` or
`{{block "placeholderName" .}}default...{{end}}` actions.

Then in the partials, you define the content for those placeholders using the
`{{define "placeholderName"}}custom...{{end}}` action.

The dot object ( `.`) in the above represents the data passed to the templates
via the `Render(data)` method.

By default the templates apply contextual (HTML, JS, CSS, URI) auto escaping so the generated template
content should be injection-safe. To render raw/verbatim trusted content in the templates you can use the
builtin `raw` function (e.g. `{{.content|raw}}`).

For more information about the template syntax please refer to the
[_html/template_](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template#hdr-A_fuller_picture)
and
[_text/template_](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template)
package godocs.
**Another great resource is also the Hashicorp's**
**[Learn Go Template Syntax](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/tutorials/templates/go-template-syntax)**
**tutorial.**

### [Example HTML page with layout](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-rendering-templates/\#example-html-page-with-layout)

Consider the following app directory structure:

`myapp/
    views/
        layout.html
        hello.html
    main.go`

We define the content for `layout.html` as:

`<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>{{block "title" .}}Default app title{{end}}</title>
</head>
<body>
    Header...
    {{block "body" .}}
        Default app body...
    {{end}}
    Footer...
</body>
</html>`

We define the content for `hello.html` as:

`{{define "title"}}
    Page 1
{{end}}
{{define "body"}}
    <p>Hello from {{.name}}</p>
{{end}}`

Then to output the final page, we'll register a custom `/hello/:name` route:

`// main.go
package main
import (
    "log"
    "net/http"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/template"
)
func main() {
    app := pocketbase.New()
    app.OnServe().BindFunc(func(se *core.ServeEvent) error {
        // this is safe to be used by multiple goroutines
        // (it acts as store for the parsed templates)
        registry := template.NewRegistry()
        se.Router.GET("/hello/{name}", func(e *core.RequestEvent) error {
            name := e.Request.PathValue("name")
            html, err := registry.LoadFiles(
                "views/layout.html",
                "views/hello.html",
            ).Render(map[string]any{
                "name": name,

### [Overview](https://pocketbase.io/docs/working-with-relations/\#overview)

Let's assume that we have the following collections structure:

![Expand diagram](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

The `relation` fields follow the same rules as any other collection field and can be set/modified
by directly updating the field value - with a record id or array of ids, in case a multiple relation is used.

Below is an example that shows creating a new **posts** record with 2 assigned tags.

JavaScript

Dart

`import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';
const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
...
const post = await pb.collection('posts').create({
    'title': 'Lorem ipsum...',
    'tags':  ['TAG_ID1', 'TAG_ID2'],
});`

`import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart';
final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
...
final post = await pb.collection('posts').create(body: {
    'title': 'Lorem ipsum...',
    'tags':  ['TAG_ID1', 'TAG_ID2'],
});`

### [Prepend/Append to multiple relation](https://pocketbase.io/docs/working-with-relations/\#prependappend-to-multiple-relation)

To prepend/append a single or multiple relation id(s) to an existing value you can use the
`+` field modifier:

JavaScript

Dart

`import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';
const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
...
const post = await pb.collection('posts').update('POST_ID', {
    // prepend single tag
    '+tags': 'TAG_ID1',
    // append multiple tags at once
    'tags+': ['TAG_ID1', 'TAG_ID2'],
})`

`import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart';
final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
...
final post = await pb.collection('posts').update('POST_ID', body: {
    // prepend single tag
    '+tags': 'TAG_ID1',
    // append multiple tags at once
    'tags+': ['TAG_ID1', 'TAG_ID2'],
})`

### [Remove from multiple relation](https://pocketbase.io/docs/working-with-relations/\#remove-from-multiple-relation)

To remove a single or multiple relation id(s) from an existing value you can use the
`-` field modifier:

JavaScript

Dart

`import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';
const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
...
const post = await pb.collection('posts').update('POST_ID', {
    // remove single tag
    'tags-': 'TAG_ID1',
    // remove multiple tags at once
    'tags-': ['TAG_ID1', 'TAG_ID2'],
})`

`import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart';
final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
...
final post = await pb.collection('posts').update('POST_ID', body: {
    // remove single tag
    'tags-': 'TAG_ID1',
    // remove multiple tags at once
    'tags-': ['TAG_ID1', 'TAG_ID2'],
})`

### [Expanding relations](https://pocketbase.io/docs/working-with-relations/\#expanding-relations)

You can also expand record relation fields directly in the returned response without making additional
requests by using the `expand` query parameter, e.g. `?expand=user,post.tags`

Only the relations that the request client can **View** (aka. satisfies the relation
collection's **View API Rule**) will be expanded.

Nested relation references in `expand`, `filter` or `sort` are supported
via dot-notation and up to 6-levels depth.

For example, to list all **comments** with their **user** relation expanded, we can
do the following:

JavaScript

Dart

`await pb.collection("comments").getList(1, 30, { expand: "user" })`

`await pb.collection("comments").getList(perPage: 30, expand: "user")`

`{
    "page": 1,
    "perPage": 30,
    "totalPages": 1,
    "totalItems": 20,
    "items": [\
        {\
            "id": "lmPJt4Z9CkLW36z",\
            "collectionId": "BHKW36mJl3ZPt6z",\
            "collectionName": "comments",\
            "created": "2022-01-01 01:00:00.456Z",\
            "updated": "2022-01-01 02:15:00.456Z",\
            "post": "WyAw4bDrvws6gGl",\
            "user": "FtHAW9feB5rze7D",\
            "message": "Example message...",\
            "expand": {\
                "user": {\
                    "id": "FtHAW9feB5rze7D",\
                    "collectionId": "srmAo0hLxEqYF7F",\
                    "collectionName": "users",\
                    "created": "2022-01-01 00:00:00.000Z",\
                    "updated": "2022-01-01 00:00:00.000Z",\
                    "username": "users54126",\
                    "verified": false,\
                    "emailVisibility": false,\
                    "name": "John Doe"\
                }\
            }\
        },\
        ...\
    ]
}`

### [Back-relations](https://pocketbase.io/docs/working-with-relations/\#back-relations)

PocketBase supports also `filter`, `sort` and `expand` for
**back-relations**
\- relations where the associated `relation` field is not in the main collection.

The following notation is used: `referenceCollection_via_relField` (ex.
`comments_via_post`).

For example, lets list the **posts** that has at least one **comments** record
containing the word _"hello"_:

JavaScript

Dart

`await pb.collection("posts").getList(1, 30, {
    filter: "comments_via_post.message ?~ 'hello'"
    expand: "comments_via_post.user",
})`

`await pb.collection("posts").getList(
    perPage: 30,
    filter: "comments_via_post.message ?~ 'hello'"
    expand: "comments_via_post.user",
)`

`{
    "page": 1,
    "perPage": 30,
    "totalPages": 2,
    "totalItems": 45,
    "items": [\
        {\
            "id": "WyAw4bDrvws6gGl",\
            "collectionId": "1rAwHJatkTNCUIN",\
            "collectionName": "posts",\
            "created": "2022-01-01 01:00:00.456Z",\
            "updated": "2022-01-01 02:15:00.456Z",\
            "title": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit...",\
            "expand": {\
                "comments_via_post": [\
                    {\
                        "id": "lmPJt4Z9CkLW36z",\

                                "name": "John Doe"\
                            }\
                        }\

            }\
        },\
        ...\
    ]
}`

###### [Back-relation caveats](https://pocketbase.io/docs/working-with-relations/\#back-relation-caveats)

- By default the back-relation reference is resolved as a dynamic
_multiple_ relation field, even when the back-relation field itself is marked as
_single_.



This is because the main record could have more than one _single_
back-relation reference (see in the above example that the `comments_via_post`
expand is returned as array, although the original `comments.post` field is a
_single_ relation).



The only case where the back-relation will be treated as a _single_
relation field is when there is
`UNIQUE` index constraint defined on the relation field.
- Back-relation `expand` is limited to max 1000 records per relation field. If you
need to fetch larger number of back-related records a better approach could be to send a
separate paginated `getList()` request to the back-related collection to avoid transferring
large JSON payloads and to reduce the memory usage.

## PocketBase Event Hooks
Event hooks

The standard way to modify PocketBase is through
**event hooks** in your Go code.

All hooks have 3 main methods:

- [`Bind(handler)`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/hook#Hook.Bind)
adds a new handler to the specified event hook. A handler has 3 fields:

  - `Id` _(optional)_ \- the name of the handler (could be used
     as argument for `Unbind`)
  - `Priority` _(optional)_ \- the execution order of the handler
     (if empty fallbacks to the order of registration in the code).
  - `Func` _(required)_ \- the handler function.
- [`BindFunc(func)`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/hook#Hook.BindFunc)
is similar to `Bind` but registers a new handler from just the provided function.



The registered handler is added with a default 0 priority and the id is autogenerated (the returned string
value).
- [`Trigger(event, oneOffHandlerFuncs...)`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/hook#Hook.Trigger)
triggers the event hook.


_This method rarely has to be called manually by users._

To remove an already registered hook handler, you can use the handler id and pass it to
`Unbind(id)` or remove all handlers with
`UnbindAll()` ( _!including system handlers_).

All hook handler functions share the same `func(e T) error` signature and expect
the user to call `e.Next()` if they want to proceed with the execution chain.

If you need to access the app instance from inside a hook handler, prefer using the
`e.App` field instead of reusing a parent scope app variable because the hook could be part
of a DB transaction and can cause deadlock.

Also avoid using global mutex locks inside a hook handler because it could be invoked recursively
(e.g. cascade delete) and can cause deadlock.

You can explore all available hooks below:

- [App hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#app-hooks)
- [Mailer hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#mailer-hooks)
- [Realtime hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#realtime-hooks)
- [Record model hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#record-model-hooks)
- [Collection model hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#collection-model-hooks)
- [Request hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#request-hooks)
- [Base model hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#base-model-hooks)

### [App hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/\#app-hooks)

**[OnBootstrap](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#onbootstrap)**

`OnBootstrap` hook is triggered when initializing the main
application resources (db, app settings, etc).


Note that attempting to access the database before the `e.Next()` call will result in an error.

`package main
import (
    "log"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
)
func main() {
    app := pocketbase.New()
    app.OnBootstrap().BindFunc(func(e *core.BootstrapEvent) error {
        if err := e.Next(); err != nil {
            return err
        }
        // e.App
        return nil
    })
    if err := app.Start(); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}`

**[OnServe](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#onserve)**

`OnServe` hook is triggered when the app web server is started
(after starting the TCP listener but before initializing the blocking serve task),
allowing you to adjust its options and attach new routes or middlewares.


`package main
import (
    "log"
    "net/http"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/apis"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
)
func main() {
    app := pocketbase.New()
    app.OnServe().BindFunc(func(e *core.ServeEvent) error {
        // register new "GET /hello" route
        e.Router.GET("/hello", func(e *core.RequestEvent) error {
            return e.String(200, "Hello world!")
        }).Bind(apis.RequireAuth())
        return e.Next()
    })
    if err := app.Start(); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}`

**[OnSettingsReload](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#onsettingsreload)**

`OnSettingsReload` hook is triggered every time when the `App.Settings()`
is being replaced with a new state.


Calling `e.App.Settings()` after `e.Next()` returns the new state.


`package main
import (
    "log"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
)
func main() {
    app := pocketbase.New()
    app.OnSettingsReload().BindFunc(func(e *core.SettingsReloadEvent) error {
        if err := e.Next(); err != nil {
            return err
        }
        // e.App.Settings()
        return nil
    })
    if err := app.Start(); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}`

**[OnBackupCreate](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#onbackupcreate)**

`OnBackupCreate` is triggered on each `App.CreateBackup` call.


`package main
import (
    "log"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
)
func main() {
    app := pocketbase.New()
    app.OnBackupCreate().BindFunc(func(e *core.BackupEvent) error {
        // e.App
        // e.Name    - the name of the backup to create
        // e.Exclude - list of pb_data dir entries to exclude from the backup
        return e.Next()
    })
    if err := app.Start(); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}`

**[OnBackupRestore](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#onbackuprestore)**

`OnBackupRestore` is triggered before app backup restore (aka. on `App.RestoreBackup` call).


`package main
import (
    "log"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
)
func main() {
    app := pocketbase.New()
    app.OnBackupRestore().BindFunc(func(e *core.BackupEvent) error {
        // e.App
        // e.Name    - the name of the backup to restore
        // e.Exclude - list of dir entries to exclude from the backup
        return e.Next()
    })
    if err := app.Start(); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}`

**[OnTerminate](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#onterminate)**

`OnTerminate` hook is triggered when the app is in the process
of being terminated (ex. on `SIGTERM` signal).


Note that the app could be terminated abruptly without awaiting the hook completion.


`package main
import (
    "log"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
)
func main() {
    app := pocketbase.New()
    app.OnTerminate().BindFunc(func(e *core.TerminateEvent) error {
        // e.App
        // e.IsRestart
        return e.Next()
    })
    if err := app.Start(); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}`

### [Mailer hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/\#mailer-hooks)

**[OnMailerSend](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#onmailersend)**

`OnMailerSend` hook is triggered every time when a new email is
being send using the `App.NewMailClient()` instance.


It allows intercepting the email message or to use a custom mailer client.

`package main
import (
    "log"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
)
func main() {
    app := pocketbase.New()
    app.OnMailerSend().BindFunc(func(e *core.MailerEvent) error {
        // e.App
        // e.Mailer
        // e.Message
        // ex. change the mail subject
        e.Message.Subject = "new subject"
        return e.Next()
    })
    if err := app.Start(); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}`

**[OnMailerRecordAuthAlertSend](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#onmailerrecordauthalertsend)**

`OnMailerRecordAuthAlertSend` hook is triggered when
sending a new device login auth alert email, allowing you to
intercept and customize the email message that is being sent.


`package main
import (
    "log"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
)
func main() {
    app := pocketbase.New()
    app.OnMailerRecordAuthAlertSend().BindFunc(func(e *core.MailerRecordEvent) error {
        // e.App
        // e.Mailer
        // e.Message
        // e.Record

### [Record model hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/\#record-model-hooks)

These are lower level Record model hooks and could be triggered from anywhere (custom console command, scheduled cron job, when calling `e.Save(record)`, etc.) and therefore they have no access to the request context!

If you want to intercept the builtin Web APIs and to access their request body, query parameters, headers or the request auth state, then please use the designated
[Record `*Request` hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#request-hooks)
.

**[OnRecordEnrich](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#onrecordenrich)**

`OnRecordEnrich` is triggered every time when a record is enriched
\- as part of the builtin Record responses, during realtime message serialization, or when `apis.EnrichRecord` is invoked.


It could be used for example to redact/hide or add computed temporary
Record model props only for the specific request info.


`package main
import (
    "log"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
)
func main() {
    app := pocketbase.New()
    app.OnRecordEnrich("posts").BindFunc(func(e *core.RecordEnrichEvent) error {
        // hide one or more fields
        e.Record.Hide("role")
        // add new custom field for registered users
        if e.RequestInfo.Auth != nil && e.RequestInfo.Auth.Collection().Name == "users" {
            e.Record.WithCustomData(true) // for security requires explicitly allowing it
            e.Record.Set("computedScore", e.Record.GetInt("score") * e.RequestInfo.Auth.GetInt("base"))
        }
        return e.Next()
    })
    if err := app.Start(); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}`

**[OnRecordValidate](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#onrecordvalidate)**

`OnRecordValidate` is a Record proxy model hook of `OnModelValidate`.


`OnRecordValidate` is called every time when a Record is being validated,
e.g. triggered by `App.Validate()` or `App.Save()`.


`package main
import (
    "log"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
)
func main() {
    app := pocketbase.New()
    // fires for every record
    app.OnRecordValidate().BindFunc(func(e *core.RecordEvent) error {
        // e.App
        // e.Record
        return e.Next()
    })
    // fires only for "users" and "articles" records
    app.OnRecordValidate("users", "articles").BindFunc(func(e *core.RecordEvent) error {
        // e.App
        // e.Record
        return e.Next()
    })
    if err := app.Start(); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}`

###### [Record model create hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/\#record-model-create-hooks)

**[OnRecordCreate](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#onrecordcreate)**

`OnRecordCreate` is a Record proxy model hook of `OnModelCreate`.


`OnRecordCreate` is triggered every time when a new Record is being created,
e.g. triggered by `App.Save()`.


Operations BEFORE the `e.Next()` execute before the Record validation
and the INSERT DB statement.


Operations AFTER the `e.Next()` execute after the Record validation
and the INSERT DB statement.


Note that successful execution doesn't guarantee that the Record
is persisted in the database since its wrapping transaction may
not have been committed yet.
If you want to listen to only the actual persisted events, you can
bind to `OnRecordAfterCreateSuccess` or `OnRecordAfterCreateError` hooks.


`package main
import (
    "log"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
)
func main() {
    app := pocketbase.New()
    // fires for every record
    app.OnRecordCreate().BindFunc(func(e *core.RecordEvent) error {
        // e.App
        // e.Record
        return e.Next()
    })
    // fires only for "users" and "articles" records
    app.OnRecordCreate("users", "articles").BindFunc(func(e *core.RecordEvent) error {

    }
}`

**[OnRecordCreateExecute](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#onrecordcreateexecute)**

`OnRecordCreateExecute` is a Record proxy model hook of `OnModelCreateExecute`.


`OnRecordCreateExecute` is triggered after successful Record validation
and right before the model INSERT DB statement execution.


Usually it is triggered as part of the `App.Save()` in the following firing order:


`OnRecordCreate`

 -\> `OnRecordValidate` (skipped with `App.SaveNoValidate()`)


 -\> `OnRecordCreateExecute`

Note that successful execution doesn't guarantee that the Record
is persisted in the database since its wrapping transaction may
not have been committed yet.
If you want to listen to only the actual persisted events, you can
bind to `OnRecordAfterCreateSuccess` or `OnRecordAfterCreateError` hooks.


`package main
import (
    "log"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"

        // e.App
        // e.Record
        return e.Next()
    })
    // fires only for "users" and "articles" records

}`

**[OnRecordAfterCreateSuccess](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#onrecordaftercreatesuccess)**

`OnRecordAfterCreateSuccess` is a Record proxy model hook of `OnModelAfterCreateSuccess`.


`OnRecordAfterCreateSuccess` is triggered after each successful
Record DB create persistence.


Note that when a Record is persisted as part of a transaction,
this hook is delayed and executed only AFTER the transaction has been committed.
This hook is NOT triggered in case the transaction fails/rollbacks.


`package main
import (
    "log"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"

`OnRecordAfterCreateError` is a Record proxy model hook of `OnModelAfterCreateError`.


`OnRecordAfterCreateError` is triggered after each failed
Record DB create persistence.


Note that the execution of this hook is either immediate or delayed
depending on the error:


- **immediate** on `App.Save()` failure
- **delayed** on transaction rollback

`package main
import (
    "log"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
)
func main() {
    app := pocketbase.New()
    // fires for every record

**[OnRecordAfterDeleteError](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#onrecordafterdeleteerror)**

`OnRecordAfterDeleteError` is a Record proxy model hook of `OnModelAfterDeleteError`.


`OnRecordAfterDeleteError` is triggered after each failed
Record DB delete persistence.


Note that the execution of this hook is either immediate or delayed
depending on the error:


- **immediate** on `App.Delete()` failure
- **delayed** on transaction rollback

`package main
import (
    "log"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
)
func main() {
    app := pocketbase.New()
    // fires for every record
    app.OnRecordAfterDeleteError().BindFunc(func(e *core.RecordErrorEvent) error {
        // e.App
        // e.Record
        // e.Error
        return e.Next()
    })
    // fires only for "users" and "articles" records
    app.OnRecordAfterDeleteError("users", "articles").BindFunc(func(e *core.RecordErrorEvent) error {
        // e.App

        return e.Next()
    })
    if err := app.Start(); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}`

### [Collection model hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/\#collection-model-hooks)

These are lower level Collection model hooks and could be triggered from anywhere (custom console command, scheduled cron job, when calling `e.Save(collection)`, etc.) and therefore they have no access to the request context!

If you want to intercept the builtin Web APIs and to access their request body, query parameters, headers or the request auth state, then please use the designated
[Collection `*Request` hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#collection-request-hooks)
.

**[OnCollectionValidate](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#oncollectionvalidate)**

`OnCollectionValidate` is a Collection proxy model hook of `OnModelValidate`.


`OnCollectionValidate` is called every time when a Collection is being validated,
e.g. triggered by `App.Validate()` or `App.Save()`.


`package main
import (
    "log"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
)
func main() {
    app := pocketbase.New()
    // fires for every collection
    app.OnCollectionValidate().BindFunc(func(e *core.CollectionEvent) error {
        // e.App
        // e.Collection
        return e.Next()
    })
    // fires only for "users" and "articles" collections
    app.OnCollectionValidate("users", "articles").BindFunc(func(e *core.CollectionEvent) error {
        // e.App
        // e.Collection
        return e.Next()
    })
    if err := app.Start(); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}`

###### [Collection mode create hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/\#collection-mode-create-hooks)

**[OnCollectionCreate](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#oncollectioncreate)**

`OnCollectionCreate` is a Collection proxy model hook of `OnModelCreate`.


`OnCollectionCreate` is triggered every time when a new Collection is being created,
e.g. triggered by `App.Save()`.


Operations BEFORE the `e.Next()` execute before the Collection validation
and the INSERT DB statement.


Operations AFTER the `e.Next()` execute after the Collection validation
and the INSERT DB statement.


Note that successful execution doesn't guarantee that the Collection
is persisted in the database since its wrapping transaction may
not have been committed yet.
If you want to listen to only the actual persisted events, you can
bind to `OnCollectionAfterCreateSuccess` or `OnCollectionAfterCreateError` hooks.


`package main
import (
    "log"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
)
func main() {
    app := pocketbase.New()
    // fires for every collection
    app.OnCollectionCreate().BindFunc(func(e *core.CollectionEvent) error {
        // e.App
        // e.Collection
        return e.Next()
    })
    // fires only for "users" and "articles" collections
    app.OnCollectionCreate("users", "articles").BindFunc(func(e *core.CollectionEvent) error {
        // e.App
        // e.Collection
        return e.Next()
    })
    if err := app.Start(); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}`

**[OnCollectionCreateExecute](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#oncollectioncreateexecute)**

`OnCollectionCreateExecute` is a Collection proxy model hook of `OnModelCreateExecute`.


`OnCollectionCreateExecute` is triggered after successful Collection validation
and right before the model INSERT DB statement execution.


Usually it is triggered as part of the `App.Save()` in the following firing order:


`OnCollectionCreate`

 -\> `OnCollectionValidate` (skipped with `App.SaveNoValidate()`)


 -\> `OnCollectionCreateExecute`

Note that successful execution doesn't guarantee that the Collection
is persisted in the database since its wrapping transaction may
not have been committed yet.
If you want to listen to only the actual persisted events, you can
bind to `OnCollectionAfterCreateSuccess` or `OnCollectionAfterCreateError` hooks.


`package main
import (
    "log"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"

        // e.App
        // e.Collection
        return e.Next()
    })
    // fires only for "users" and "articles" collections
    app.OnCollectionCreateExecute("users", "articles").BindFunc(func(e *core.CollectionEvent) error {

    }
}`

**[OnCollectionAfterCreateSuccess](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#oncollectionaftercreatesuccess)**

`OnCollectionAfterCreateSuccess` is a Collection proxy model hook of `OnModelAfterCreateSuccess`.


`OnCollectionAfterCreateSuccess` is triggered after each successful
Collection DB create persistence.


Note that when a Collection is persisted as part of a transaction,
this hook is delayed and executed only AFTER the transaction has been committed.
This hook is NOT triggered in case the transaction fails/rollbacks.


`package main
import (
    "log"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"

**[OnRecordsListRequest](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#onrecordslistrequest)**

`OnRecordsListRequest` hook is triggered on each API Records list request.
Could be used to validate or modify the response before returning it to the client.


Note that if you want to hide existing or add new computed Record fields prefer using the
[`OnRecordEnrich`](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#onrecordenrich)
hook because it is less error-prone and it is triggered
by all builtin Record responses (including when sending realtime Record events).


`package main

**[OnRecordViewRequest](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#onrecordviewrequest)**

`OnRecordViewRequest` hook is triggered on each API Record view request.
Could be used to validate or modify the response before returning it to the client.


Note that if you want to hide existing or add new computed Record fields prefer using the
[`OnRecordEnrich`](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#onrecordenrich)

}`

**[OnRecordCreateRequest](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#onrecordcreaterequest)**

`OnRecordCreateRequest` hook is triggered on each API Record create request.


Could be used to additionally validate the request data or implement
completely different persistence behavior.

### [Base model hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/\#base-model-hooks)

The Model hooks are fired for all PocketBase structs that implements the Model DB interface - Record, Collection, Log, etc.

For convenience, if you want to listen to only the Record or Collection DB model
events without doing manual type assertion, you can use the
[`OnRecord*`](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#record-model-hooks)
and
[`OnCollection*`](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#collection-model-hooks)
proxy hooks above.


**[OnModelValidate](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#onmodelvalidate)**

`OnModelValidate` is called every time when a Model is being validated,
e.g. triggered by `App.Validate()` or `App.Save()`.


For convenience, if you want to listen to only the Record or Collection models
events without doing manual type assertion, you can use the equivalent `OnRecord*` and `OnCollection*` proxy hooks.


`package main
import (
    "log"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
)
func main() {
    app := pocketbase.New()
    // fires for every model
    app.OnModelValidate().BindFunc(func(e *core.ModelEvent) error {
        // e.App
        // e.Model
        return e.Next()
    })
    // fires only for "users" and "articles" models
    app.OnModelValidate("users", "articles").BindFunc(func(e *core.ModelEvent) error {
        // e.App
        // e.Model
        return e.Next()
    })
    if err := app.Start(); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}`

###### [Base model create hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/\#base-model-create-hooks)

**[OnModelCreate](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#onmodelcreate)**

`OnModelCreate` is triggered every time when a new Model is being created,
e.g. triggered by `App.Save()`.


Operations BEFORE the `e.Next()` execute before the Model validation
and the INSERT DB statement.


Operations AFTER the `e.Next()` execute after the Model validation
and the INSERT DB statement.


Note that successful execution doesn't guarantee that the Model
is persisted in the database since its wrapping transaction may
not have been committed yet.
If you want to listen to only the actual persisted events, you can
bind to `OnModelAfterCreateSuccess` or `OnModelAfterCreateError` hooks.


For convenience, if you want to listen to only the Record or Collection models
events without doing manual type assertion, you can use the equivalent `OnRecord*` and `OnCollection*` proxy hooks.


`package main
import (
    "log"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
)
func main() {
    app := pocketbase.New()
    // fires for every model
    app.OnModelCreate().BindFunc(func(e *core.ModelEvent) error {
        // e.App
        // e.Model
        return e.Next()
    })
    // fires only for "users" and "articles" models
    app.OnModelCreate("users", "articles").BindFunc(func(e *core.ModelEvent) error {
        // e.App
        // e.Model
        return e.Next()
    })
    if err := app.Start(); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}`

**[OnModelCreateExecute](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#onmodelcreateexecute)**

`OnModelCreateExecute` is triggered after successful Model validation
and right before the model INSERT DB statement execution.


Usually it is triggered as part of the `App.Save()` in the following firing order:


`OnModelCreate`

 -\> `OnModelValidate` (skipped with `App.SaveNoValidate()`)


 -\> `OnModelCreateExecute`

Note that successful execution doesn't guarantee that the Model
is persisted in the database since its wrapping transaction may
not have been committed yet.
If you want to listen to only the actual persisted events, you can
bind to `OnModelAfterCreateSuccess` or `OnModelAfterCreateError` hooks.


For convenience, if you want to listen to only the Record or Collection models
events without doing manual type assertion, you can use the equivalent `OnRecord*` and `OnCollection*` proxy hooks.


`package main
import (
    "log"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
)
func main() {
    app := pocketbase.New()
    // fires for every model
    app.OnModelCreateExecute().BindFunc(func(e *core.ModelEvent) error {
        // e.App
        // e.Model
        return e.Next()
    })
    // fires only for "users" and "articles" models
    app.OnModelCreateExecute("users", "articles").BindFunc(func(e *core.ModelEvent) error {
        // e.App
        // e.Model
        return e.Next()
    })
    if err := app.Start(); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}`

**[OnModelAfterCreateSuccess](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#onmodelaftercreatesuccess)**

`OnModelAfterCreateSuccess` is triggered after each successful
Model DB create persistence.


Note that when a Model is persisted as part of a transaction,
this hook is delayed and executed only AFTER the transaction has been committed.
This hook is NOT triggered in case the transaction fails/rollbacks.


For convenience, if you want to listen to only the Record or Collection models
events without doing manual type assertion, you can use the equivalent `OnRecord*` and `OnCollection*` proxy hooks.


`package main
import (
    "log"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"

        // e.App
        // e.Model
        return e.Next()
    })
    // fires only for "users" and "articles" models
    app.OnModelAfterCreateSuccess("users", "articles").BindFunc(func(e *core.ModelEvent) error {
        // e.App
        // e.Model
        return e.Next()
    })
    if err := app.Start(); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}`

**[OnModelAfterCreateError](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#onmodelaftercreateerror)**

`OnModelAfterCreateError` is triggered after each failed
Model DB create persistence.


Note that the execution of this hook is either immediate or delayed
depending on the error:


- **immediate** on `App.Save()` failure
- **delayed** on transaction rollback

For convenience, if you want to listen to only the Record or Collection models
events without doing manual type assertion, you can use the equivalent `OnRecord*` and `OnCollection*` proxy hooks.


`package main
import (
    "log"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
)
func main() {
    app := pocketbase.New()

    app.OnModelAfterCreateError().BindFunc(func(e *core.ModelErrorEvent) error {
        // e.App
        // e.Model
        // e.Error
        return e.Next()
    })
    // fires only for "users" and "articles" models
    app.OnModelAfterCreateError("users", "articles").BindFunc(func(e *core.ModelErrorEvent) error {
        // e.App
        // e.Model
        // e.Error

###### [Base model update hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/\#base-model-update-hooks)

**[OnModelUpdate](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-event-hooks/#onmodelupdate)**

`OnModelUpdate` is triggered every time when a new Model is being updated,
e.g. triggered by `App.Save()`.


Operations BEFORE the `e.Next()` execute before the Model validation
and the UPDATE DB statement.


Operations AFTER the `e.Next()` execute after the Model validation
and the UPDATE DB statement.


Note that successful execution doesn't guarantee that the Model
is persisted in the database since its wrapping transaction may
not have been committed yet.
If you want to listen to only the actual persisted events, you can
bind to `OnModelAfterUpdateSuccess` or `OnModelAfterUpdateError` hooks.


For convenience, if you want to listen to only the Record or Collection models

## Record Proxy Guide
Record proxy

The available [`core.Record` and its helpers](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-records)
are usually the recommended way to interact with your data, but in case you want a typed access to your record
fields you can create a helper struct that embeds
[`core.BaseRecordProxy`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core#BaseRecordProxy) _(which implements the `core.RecordProxy` interface)_ and define your collection fields as
getters and setters.

By implementing the `core.RecordProxy` interface you can use your custom struct as part of a
`RecordQuery` result like a regular record model. In addition, every DB change through the proxy
struct will trigger the corresponding record validations and hooks. This ensures that other parts of your app,
including 3rd party plugins, that don't know or use your custom struct will still work as expected.

Below is a sample `Article` record proxy implementation:

`// article.go
package main
import (
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/types"
)
// ensures that the Article struct satisfy the core.RecordProxy interface
var _ core.RecordProxy = (*Article)(nil)
type Article struct {
    core.BaseRecordProxy
}
func (a *Article) Title() string {
    return a.GetString("title")
}
func (a *Article) SetTitle(title string) {
    a.Set("title", title)
}
func (a *Article) Slug() string {
    return a.GetString("slug")
}
func (a *Article) SetSlug(slug string) {
    a.Set("slug", slug)
}
func (a *Article) Created() types.DateTime {
    return a.GetDateTime("created")
}
func (a *Article) Updated() types.DateTime {
    return a.GetDateTime("updated")
}`

Accessing and modifying the proxy records is the same as for the regular records. Continuing with the
above `Article` example:

`func FindArticleBySlug(app core.App, slug string) (*Article, error) {
    article := &Article{}
    err := app.RecordQuery("articles").
        AndWhere(dbx.NewExp("LOWER(slug)={:slug}", dbx.Params{
            "slug": strings.ToLower(slug), // case insensitive match
        })).
        Limit(1).
        One(article)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    return article, nil
}
...
article, err := FindArticleBySlug(app, "example")
if err != nil {
    return err
}
// change the title
article.SetTitle("Lorem ipsum...")
// persist the change while also triggering the original record validations and hooks
err = app.Save(article)
if err != nil {
    return err
}`

If you have an existing `*core.Record` value you can also load it into your proxy using the
`SetProxyRecord` method:

`// fetch regular record
record, err := app.FindRecordById("articles", "RECORD_ID")
if err != nil {
    return err
}
// load into proxy
article := &Article{}
article.SetProxyRecord(record)`

## HTML Template Rendering
Rendering templates

- [Overview](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-rendering-templates/#overview)
- [Example HTML page with layout](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-rendering-templates/#example-html-page-with-layout)

### [Overview](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-rendering-templates/\#overview)

A common task when creating custom routes or emails is the need of generating HTML output. To assist with
this, PocketBase provides the global `$template` helper for parsing and rendering HTML templates.

``const html = $template.loadFiles(
    `${__hooks}/views/base.html`,
    `${__hooks}/views/partial1.html`,
    `${__hooks}/views/partial2.html`,
).render(data)``

The general flow when working with composed and nested templates is that you create "base" template(s)
that defines various placeholders using the
`{{template "placeholderName" .}}` or
`{{block "placeholderName" .}}default...{{end}}` actions.

Then in the partials, you define the content for those placeholders using the
`{{define "placeholderName"}}custom...{{end}}` action.

The dot object ( `.`) in the above represents the data passed to the templates
via the `render(data)` method.

By default the templates apply contextual (HTML, JS, CSS, URI) auto escaping so the generated template
content should be injection-safe. To render raw/verbatim trusted content in the templates you can use the
builtin `raw` function (e.g. `{{.content|raw}}`).

For more information about the template syntax please refer to the
[_html/template_](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template#hdr-A_fuller_picture)
and
[_text/template_](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template)
package godocs.
**Another great resource is also the Hashicorp's**
**[Learn Go Template Syntax](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/tutorials/templates/go-template-syntax)**
**tutorial.**

### [Example HTML page with layout](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-rendering-templates/\#example-html-page-with-layout)

Consider the following app directory structure:

`myapp/
    pb_hooks/
        views/
            layout.html
            hello.html
        main.pb.js
    pocketbase`

We define the content for `layout.html` as:

`<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>{{block "title" .}}Default app title{{end}}</title>
</head>
<body>
    Header...
    {{block "body" .}}
        Default app body...
    {{end}}
    Footer...
</body>
</html>`

We define the content for `hello.html` as:

`{{define "title"}}
    Page 1
{{end}}
{{define "body"}}
    <p>Hello from {{.name}}</p>
{{end}}`

Then to output the final page, we'll register a custom `/hello/:name` route:

``routerAdd("get", "/hello/{name}", (e) => {
    const name = e.request.pathValue("name")
    const html = $template.loadFiles(
        `${__hooks}/views/layout.html`,
        `${__hooks}/views/hello.html`,
    ).render({
        "name": name,
    })
    return e.html(200, html)
})``

## Sending Emails
Sending emails

PocketBase provides a simple abstraction for sending emails via the
`$app.newMailClient()` helper.

Depending on your configured mail settings ( _Dashboard > Settings > Mail settings_) it will use the
`sendmail` command or a SMTP client.

- [Send custom email](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-sending-emails/#send-custom-email)
- [Overwrite system emails](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-sending-emails/#overwrite-system-emails)

### [Send custom email](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-sending-emails/\#send-custom-email)

You can send your own custom emails from everywhere within the app (hooks, middlewares, routes, etc.) by
using `$app.newMailClient().send(message)`. Here is an example of sending a custom email after
user registration:

`onRecordCreateRequest((e) => {
    e.next()
    const message = new MailerMessage({
        from: {
            address: e.app.settings().meta.senderAddress,
            name:    e.app.settings().meta.senderName,
        },
        to:      [{address: e.record.email()}],
        subject: "YOUR_SUBJECT...",
        html:    "YOUR_HTML_BODY...",
        // bcc, cc and custom headers are also supported...
    })
    e.app.newMailClient().send(message)
}, "users")`

### [Overwrite system emails](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-sending-emails/\#overwrite-system-emails)

If you want to overwrite the default system emails for forgotten password, verification, etc., you can
adjust the default templates available from the
_Dashboard > Collections > Edit collection > Options_
.

Alternatively, you can also apply individual changes by binding to one of the
[mailer hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-event-hooks/#mailer-hooks). Here is an example of appending a Record
field value to the subject using the `onMailerRecordPasswordResetSend` hook:

`onMailerRecordPasswordResetSend((e) => {
    // modify the subject
    e.message.subject += (" " + e.record.get("name"))
    e.next()
})`

[Prev: Jobs scheduling](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-jobs-scheduling) [Next: Rendering templates](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-rendering-templates)

## Jobs Scheduling
Jobs scheduling

If you have tasks that need to be performed periodically, you could setup crontab-like jobs with
`cronAdd(id, expr, handler)`.

Each scheduled job runs in its own goroutine as part of the `serve` command process and must have:

- **id** \- identifier for the scheduled job; could be used to replace or remove an existing
job
- **cron expression** \- e.g. `0 0 * * *` (
_supports numeric list, steps, ranges or_
_macros_)
- **handler** \- the function that will be executed every time when the job runs

Here is an example:

`// prints "Hello!" every 2 minutes
cronAdd("hello", "*/2 * * * *", () => {
    console.log("Hello!")
})`

To remove a single registered cron job you can call `cronRemove(id)`.

All registered app level cron jobs can be also previewed and triggered from the
_Dashboard > Settings > Crons_ section.

## Jobs Scheduling
Jobs scheduling

If you have tasks that need to be performed periodically, you could setup crontab-like jobs with the
builtin `app.Cron()` _(it returns an app scoped_
_[`cron.Cron`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/cron#Cron) value)_
.

The jobs scheduler is started automatically on app `serve`, so all you have to do is register a
handler with
[`app.Cron().Add(id, cronExpr, handler)`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/cron#Cron.Add)
or
[`app.Cron().MustAdd(id, cronExpr, handler)`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/cron#Cron.MustAdd)
( _the latter panic if the cron expression is not valid_).

Each scheduled job runs in its own goroutine and must have:

- **id** \- identifier for the scheduled job; could be used to replace or remove an existing
job
- **cron expression** \- e.g. `0 0 * * *` (
_supports numeric list, steps, ranges or_
_macros_)
- **handler** \- the function that will be executed everytime when the job runs

Here is one minimal example:

`// main.go
package main
import (
    "log"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
)
func main() {
    app := pocketbase.New()
    // prints "Hello!" every 2 minutes
    app.Cron().MustAdd("hello", "*/2 * * * *", func() {
        log.Println("Hello!")
    })
    if err := app.Start(); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}`

To remove already registered cron job you can call
[`app.Cron().Remove(id)`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/cron#Cron.Remove)

All registered app level cron jobs can be also previewed and triggered from the
_Dashboard > Settings > Crons_ section.

Keep in mind that the `app.Cron()` is also used for running the system scheduled jobs
like the logs cleanup or auto backups (the jobs id is in the format `__pb*__`) and
replacing these system jobs or calling `RemoveAll()`/ `Stop()` could have unintended
side-effects.

If you want more advanced control you can initialize your own cron instance independent from the
application via `cron.New()`.

## Custom Console Commands
Console commands

You can register custom console commands using
`app.RootCmd.AddCommand(cmd)`, where `cmd` is a
[cobra](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/spf13/cobra) command.

Here is an example:

`package main
import (
    "log"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
    "github.com/spf13/cobra"
)
func main() {
    app := pocketbase.New()
    app.RootCmd.AddCommand(&cobra.Command{
        Use: "hello",
        Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
            log.Println("Hello world!")
        },
    })
    if err := app.Start(); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}`

To run the command you can build your Go application and execute:

`# or "go run main.go hello"
./myapp hello`

Keep in mind that the console commands execute in their own separate app process and run
independently from the main `serve` command (aka. hook events between different processes
are not shared with one another).

## API Rules and Filters
API rules and filters

- [API rules](https://pocketbase.io/docs/api-rules-and-filters/#api-rules)
- [Filters syntax](https://pocketbase.io/docs/api-rules-and-filters/#filters-syntax)
- [Special identifiers and modifiers](https://pocketbase.io/docs/api-rules-and-filters/#special-identifiers-and-modifiers)
  - [@ macros](https://pocketbase.io/docs/api-rules-and-filters/#-macros)
  - [:isset modifier](https://pocketbase.io/docs/api-rules-and-filters/#isset-modifier)
  - [:length modifier](https://pocketbase.io/docs/api-rules-and-filters/#length-modifier)
  - [:each modifier](https://pocketbase.io/docs/api-rules-and-filters/#each-modifier)
  - [:lower modifier](https://pocketbase.io/docs/api-rules-and-filters/#lower-modifier)
- [Examples](https://pocketbase.io/docs/api-rules-and-filters/#examples)

### [API rules](https://pocketbase.io/docs/api-rules-and-filters/\#api-rules)

**API Rules** are your collection access controls and data filters.

Each collection has **5 rules**, corresponding to the specific API action:

- `listRule`
- `viewRule`
- `createRule`
- `updateRule`
- `deleteRule`

Auth collections has an additional `options.manageRule` used to allow one user (it could be even
from a different collection) to be able to fully manage the data of another user (ex. changing their email,
password, etc.).

Each rule could be set to:

- **"locked"** \- aka. `null`, which means that the action could be performed
only by an authorized superuser

( **this is the default**)
- **Empty string** \- anyone will be able to perform the action (superusers, authorized users
and guests)
- **Non-empty string** \- only users (authorized or not) that satisfy the rule filter expression
will be able to perform this action

**PocketBase API Rules act also as records filter!**

Or in other words, you could for example allow listing only the "active" records of your collection,
by using a simple filter expression such as:
`status = "active"`
(where "status" is a field defined in your Collection).

Because of the above, the API will return 200 empty items response in case a request doesn't
satisfy a `listRule`, 400 for unsatisfied `createRule` and 404 for
unsatisfied `viewRule`, `updateRule` and `deleteRule`.


All rules will return 403 in case they were "locked" (aka. superuser only) and the request client is
not a superuser.

The API Rules are ignored when the action is performed by an authorized superuser ( **superusers can access everything**)!

### [Filters syntax](https://pocketbase.io/docs/api-rules-and-filters/\#filters-syntax)

You can find information about the available fields in your collection API rules tab:

![Collection API Rules filters screenshot](https://pocketbase.io/images/screenshots/collection-rules.png)

There is autocomplete to help you guide you while typing the rule filter expression, but in general you
have access to **3 groups of fields**:

- **Your Collection schema fields**


This includes all nested relation fields too, ex.
`someRelField.status != "pending"`
- `@request.*`


Used to access the current request data, such as query parameters, body/form fields, authorized user state,
etc.

  - `@request.context` \- the context where the rule is used (ex.
     `@request.context != "oauth2"`)


    The currently supported context values are
     `default`,
     `oauth2`,
     `otp`,
     `password`,
     `realtime`,
     `protectedFile`.
  - `@request.method` \- the HTTP request method (ex.
     `@request.method = "GET"`)
  - `@request.headers.*` \- the request headers as string values (ex.
     `@request.headers.x_token = "test"`)


    Note: All header keys are normalized to lowercase and "-" is replaced with "\_" (for
     example "X-Token" is "x\_token").
  - `@request.query.*` \- the request query parameters as string values (ex.
     `@request.query.page = "1"`)
  - `@request.auth.*` \- the current authenticated model (ex.
     `@request.auth.id != ""`)
  - `@request.body.*` \- the submitted body parameters (ex.
     `@request.body.title != ""`)


    Note: Uploaded files are not part of the `@request.body`
     because they are evaluated separately ( _this behavior may change in the future_).
- `@collection.*`
This filter could be used to target other collections that are not directly related to the current
one (aka. there is no relation field pointing to it) but both shares a common field value, like
for example a category id:

`@collection.news.categoryId ?= categoryId && @collection.news.author ?= @request.auth.id`

In case you want to join the same collection multiple times but based on different criteria, you
can define an alias by appending `:alias` suffix to the collection name.

`// see https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/discussions/3805#discussioncomment-7634791
@request.auth.id != "" &&
@collection.courseRegistrations.user ?= id &&
@collection.courseRegistrations:auth.user ?= @request.auth.id &&
@collection.courseRegistrations.courseGroup ?= @collection.courseRegistrations:auth.courseGroup`


The syntax basically follows the format
`OPERAND OPERATOR OPERAND`, where:

- `OPERAND` \- could be any field literal, string (single or double quoted),
number, null, true, false
- `OPERATOR` \- is one of:



  - `=` Equal
  - `!=` NOT equal
  - `>` Greater than
  - `>=` Greater than or equal
  - `<` Less than
  - `<=` Less than or equal
  - `~` Like/Contains (if not specified auto wraps the right string OPERAND in a "%" for wildcard
     match)
  - `!~` NOT Like/Contains (if not specified auto wraps the right string OPERAND in a "%" for
     wildcard match)
  - `?=` _Any/At least one of_ Equal
  - `?!=` _Any/At least one of_ NOT equal
  - `?>` _Any/At least one of_ Greater than
  - `?>=` _Any/At least one of_ Greater than or equal
  - `?<` _Any/At least one of_ Less than
  - `?<=` _Any/At least one of_ Less than or equal
  - `?~` _Any/At least one of_ Like/Contains (if not specified auto wraps the right string OPERAND in a "%" for wildcard
     match)
  - `?!~` _Any/At least one of_ NOT Like/Contains (if not specified auto wraps the right string OPERAND in a "%" for
     wildcard match)

To group and combine several expressions you can use parenthesis
`(...)`, `&&` (AND) and `||` (OR) tokens.

Single line comments are also supported: `// Example comment`.

### [Special identifiers and modifiers](https://pocketbase.io/docs/api-rules-and-filters/\#special-identifiers-and-modifiers)

##### [@ macros](https://pocketbase.io/docs/api-rules-and-filters/\#-macros)

The following datetime macros are available and can be used as part of the filter expression:

`// all macros are UTC based
@now        - the current datetime as string
@second     - @now second number (0-59)
@minute     - @now minute number (0-59)
@hour       - @now hour number (0-23)
@weekday    - @now weekday number (0-6)
@day        - @now day number
@month      - @now month number
@year       - @now year number
@yesterday  - the yesterday datetime relative to @now as string
@tomorrow   - the tomorrow datetime relative to @now as string
@todayStart - beginning of the current day as datetime string
@todayEnd   - end of the current day as datetime string
@monthStart - beginning of the current month as datetime string
@monthEnd   - end of the current month as datetime string
@yearStart  - beginning of the current year as datetime string
@yearEnd    - end of the current year as datetime string`

For example:

`@request.body.publicDate >= @now`

##### [:isset modifier](https://pocketbase.io/docs/api-rules-and-filters/\#isset-modifier)

The `:isset` field modifier is available only for the `@request.*` fields and can be
used to check whether the client submitted a specific data with the request. Here is for example a rule that
disallows changing a "role" field:

`@request.body.role:isset = false`

Note that `@request.body.*:isset` at the moment doesn't support checking for
new uploaded files because they are evaluated separately and cannot be serialized ( _this behavior may change in the future_).

##### [:length modifier](https://pocketbase.io/docs/api-rules-and-filters/\#length-modifier)

The `:length` field modifier could be used to check the number of items in an array field
(multiple `file`, `select`, `relation`).


Could be used with both the collection schema fields and the `@request.body.*` fields. For example:

`// check example submitted data: {"someSelectField": ["val1", "val2"]}
@request.body.someSelectField:length > 1
// check existing record field length
someRelationField:length = 2`

Note that `@request.body.*:length` at the moment doesn't support checking
for new uploaded files because they are evaluated separately and cannot be serialized ( _this behavior may change in the future_).

##### [:each modifier](https://pocketbase.io/docs/api-rules-and-filters/\#each-modifier)

The `:each` field modifier works only with multiple `select`, `file` and
`relation`
type fields. It could be used to apply a condition on each item from the field array. For example:

`// check if all submitted select options contain the "create" text
@request.body.someSelectField:each ~ "create"
// check if all existing someSelectField has "pb_" prefix
someSelectField:each ~ "pb_%"`

Note that `@request.body.*:each` at the moment doesn't support checking for
new uploaded files because they are evaluated separately and cannot be serialized ( _this behavior may change in the future_).

##### [:lower modifier](https://pocketbase.io/docs/api-rules-and-filters/\#lower-modifier)

The `:lower` field modifier could be used to perform lower-case string comparisons. For example:

`// check if the submitted lower-cased body "title" field is equal to "test" ("Test", "tEsT", etc.)
@request.body.title:lower = "test"
// match existing records with lower-cased "title" equal to "test" ("Test", "tEsT", etc.)
title:lower ~ "test"`

Under the hood it uses the
[SQLite `LOWER` scalar function](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html#lower)
and by default works only for ASCII characters, unless the ICU extension is loaded.

### [Examples](https://pocketbase.io/docs/api-rules-and-filters/\#examples)

- Allow only registered users:

`@request.auth.id != ""`

- Allow only registered users and return records that are either "active" or "pending":

`@request.auth.id != "" && (status = "active" || status = "pending")`

- Allow only registered users who are listed in an _allowed\_users_ multi-relation field value:

`@request.auth.id != "" && allowed_users.id ?= @request.auth.id`

- Allow access by anyone and return only the records where the _title_ field value starts with
"Lorem" (ex. "Lorem ipsum"):

`title ~ "Lorem%"`

## Sending HTTP Requests
Sending HTTP requests

- [Overview](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-sending-http-requests/#overview)
  - [multipart/form-data requests](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-sending-http-requests/#multipartform-data-requests)
- [Limitations](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-sending-http-requests/#limitations)

### [Overview](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-sending-http-requests/\#overview)

You can use the global `$http.send(config)` helper to send HTTP requests to external services.


This could be used for example to retrieve data from external data sources, to make custom requests to a payment
provider API, etc.

Below is a list with all currently supported config options and their defaults.

`// throws on timeout or network connectivity error
const res = $http.send({
    url:     "",
    method:  "GET",
    body:    "", // ex. JSON.stringify({"test": 123}) or new FormData()
    headers: {}, // ex. {"content-type": "application/json"}
    timeout: 120, // in seconds
})
console.log(res.headers)    // the response headers (ex. res.headers['X-Custom'][0])
console.log(res.cookies)    // the response cookies (ex. res.cookies.sessionId.value)
console.log(res.statusCode) // the response HTTP status code
console.log(res.raw)        // the response body as plain text
console.log(res.json)       // the response body as parsed json array or map`

Here is an example that will enrich a single book record with some data based on its ISBN details from
openlibrary.org.

`onRecordCreateRequest((e) => {
    let isbn = e.record.get("isbn");
    // try to update with the published date from the openlibrary API
    try {
        const res = $http.send({
            url: "https://openlibrary.org/isbn/" + isbn + ".json",
            headers: {"content-type": "application/json"}
        })
        if (res.statusCode == 200) {
            e.record.set("published", res.json.publish_date)
        }
    } catch (err) {
        e.app.logger().error("Failed to retrieve book data", "error", err);
    }
    return e.next()
}, "books")`

##### [multipart/form-data requests](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-sending-http-requests/\#multipartform-data-requests)

In order to send `multipart/form-data` requests (ex. uploading files) the request
`body` must be a `FormData` instance.

PocketBase JSVM's `FormData` has the same APIs as its
[browser equivalent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData)
with the main difference that for file values instead of `Blob` it accepts
[`$filesystem.File`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/modules/_filesystem.html).

`const formData = new FormData();
formData.append("title", "Hello world!")
formData.append("documents", $filesystem.fileFromBytes("doc1", "doc1.txt"))
formData.append("documents", $filesystem.fileFromBytes("doc2", "doc2.txt"))
const res = $http.send({
    url:    "https://...",
    method: "POST",
    body:   formData,
})
console.log(res.statusCode)`

### [Limitations](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-sending-http-requests/\#limitations)

As of now there is no support for streamed responses or server-sent events (SSE). The
`$http.send` call blocks and returns the entire response body at once.

For this and other more advanced use cases you'll have to
[extend PocketBase with Go](https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-overview/).

[Prev: Console commands](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-console-commands) [Next: Realtime messaging](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-realtime)

## PocketBase Realtime Messaging
Realtime messaging

By default PocketBase sends realtime events only for Record create/update/delete operations ( _and for the OAuth2 auth redirect_), but you are free to send custom realtime messages to the connected clients via the
[`$app.subscriptionsBroker()`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/functions/_app.subscriptionsBroker.html) instance.

[`$app.subscriptionsBroker().clients()`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/interfaces/subscriptions.Broker.html#clients)
returns all connected
[`subscriptions.Client`](https://pocketbase.io/jsvm/interfaces/subscriptions.Client.html)
indexed by their unique connection id.

The current auth record associated with a client could be accessed through
`client.get("auth")`

Note that a single authenticated user could have more than one active realtime connection (aka.
multiple clients). This could happen for example when opening the same app in different tabs,
browsers, devices, etc.

Below you can find a minimal code sample that sends a JSON payload to all clients subscribed to the
"example" topic:

`const message = new SubscriptionMessage({
    name: "example",
    data: JSON.stringify({ ... }),
});
// retrieve all clients (clients id indexed map)
const clients = $app.subscriptionsBroker().clients()
for (let clientId in clients) {
    if (clients[clientId].hasSubscription("example")) {
        clients[clientId].send(message)
    }
}`

From the client-side, users can listen to the custom subscription topic by doing something like:

JavaScript

Dart

`import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';
const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
...
await pb.realtime.subscribe('example', (e) => {
    console.log(e)
})`

`import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart';
final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
...
await pb.realtime.subscribe('example', (e) {
    print(e)
})`

## Using PocketBase APIs
How to use PocketBase

The easiest way to use PocketBase is by interacting with its Web APIs directly from the client-side (e.g.
mobile app or browser SPA).

It was designed with this exact use case in mind and it is also the reason why there are general purpose
JSON APIs for listing, pagination, sorting, filtering, etc.

The access and filter controls for your data is usually done through the
[collection API rules](https://pocketbase.io/docs/api-rules-and-filters/)
.

For the cases when you need more specialized handling (sending emails, intercepting the default actions,
creating new routes, etc.) you can
[extend PocketBase with Go or JavaScript](https://pocketbase.io/docs/use-as-framework/)
.

For interacting with the
[Web APIs](https://pocketbase.io/docs/api-records/)
you can make use of the official SDK clients:

- [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/pocketbase/js-sdk)(Browser, Node.js, React Native)
- [Dart SDK](https://github.com/pocketbase/dart-sdk)(Web, Mobile, Desktop, CLI)

When used on the client-side, it is safe to have a single/global SDK instance for the entire lifecycle of
your application.

**[Web apps recommendation](https://pocketbase.io/docs/how-to-use/#web-apps-recommendation)**

Not everyone will agree with this, but if you are building a web app with PocketBase I recommend
developing the frontend as a **traditional client-side SPA** and for the cases where additional
server-side handling is needed (e.g. for payment webhooks, extra data server validations, etc.) you
could try to:

- [Use PocketBase as Go/JS framework](https://pocketbase.io/docs/use-as-framework) to create new routes or
intercept existing.
- Create one-off Node.js/Bun/Deno/etc. server-side actions that will interact with
PocketBase only as superuser and as pure data store (similar to traditional database
interactions but over HTTP). In this case it is safe to have a global superuser client
such as:

`// src/superuser.js
import PocketBase from "pocketbase"
const superuserClient = new PocketBase('https://example.com');
// disable autocancellation so that we can handle async requests from multiple users
superuserClient.autoCancellation(false);
// option 1: authenticate as superuser using email/password (could be filled with ENV params)
await superuserClient.collection('_superusers').authWithPassword(SUPERUSER_EMAIL, SUPERUSER_PASS, {
    // This will trigger auto refresh or auto reauthentication in case
    // the token has expired or is going to expire in the next 30 minutes.
    autoRefreshThreshold: 30 * 60
})
// option 2: OR authenticate as superuser via long-lived "API key"
// (see https://pocketbase.io/docs/authentication/#api-keys)
superuserClient.authStore.save('YOUR_GENERATED_SUPERUSER_TOKEN')
export default superuserClient;`

Then you can import directly the file in your server-side actions and use the client as
usual:

`import superuserClient from './src/superuser.js'
async function serverAction(req, resp) {
    ... do some extra data validations or handling ...
    // send a create request as superuser
    await superuserClient.collection('example').create({ ... })
}`


**[Why not JS SSR](https://pocketbase.io/docs/how-to-use/#why-not-js-ssr)**

Using PocketBase with meta framework such as SvelteKit, Nuxt, Next.js, etc.
**in a JS SSR mode**
is possible but it comes with many complications and you need to carefully evaluate whether the cost
of having another backend (PocketBase) along-side your existing one (the Node.js server) is worth it.

You can read more about the potential problems in
[JS SSR - issues and recommendations #5313](https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/discussions/5313) but some of the common pitfalls are:

- Security issues caused by incorrectly initialized and shared JS SDK instance in a long-running
server-side context.
- OAuth2 integration difficulties related to the server-side only OAuth2 flow (or its mixed
"all-in-one" client-side handling and sharing a cookie with the server-side).
- Proxying realtime connections and essentially duplicating the same thing PocketBase already
does.
- Performance bottlenecks caused by the default single-threaded Node.js process and the
excessive resources utilization due to the server-side rendering and heavy back-and-forth
requests communication between the different layers (client<->Node.js<->PocketBase).

This doesn't mean that using PocketBase with JS SSR is always a "bad thing" but based on the
dozens reported issues so far I would recommend it only after careful evaluation and only to more
experienced developers that have in-depth understanding of the used tools and their trade-offs. If
you still want to use PocketBase to handle regular users authentication with a JS SSR meta
framework, then you can find some JS SDK examples in the repo's
[JS SSR integration section](https://github.com/pocketbase/js-sdk#ssr-integration).

**[Why not htmx, Hotwire/Turbo, Unpoly, etc.](https://pocketbase.io/docs/how-to-use/#why-not-htmx-hotwireturbo-unpoly-etc-)**

htmx, Hotwire/Turbo, Unpoly and other similar tools are commonly used for building server rendered
applications but unfortunately they don't play well with the JSON APIs and fully stateless nature
of PocketBase.

It is possible to use them with PocketBase but at the moment I don't recommend it because we lack
the necessary helpers and utilities for building SSR-first applications, which means that you
might have to create from scratch a lot of things on your own such as middlewares for handling
cookies ( _and eventually taking care also for CORS and CSRF_) or custom authentication
endpoints and access controls ( _the collection API rules apply only for the builtin JSON routes_).

In the future we could eventually provide official SSR support in terms of guides and middlewares
for this use case but again - PocketBase wasn't designed with this in mind and you may want to
reevaluate the tech stack of your application and switch to a traditional client-side SPA as
mentioned earlier or use a different backend solution that might fit better with your use case.

**[Mobile apps auth persistence](https://pocketbase.io/docs/how-to-use/#mobile-apps-auth-persistence)**

When building mobile apps with the JavaScript SDK or Dart SDK you'll have to specify a custom
persistence store if you want to preserve the authentication between the various app activities
and open/close state.

The SDKs comes with a helper async storage implementation that allows you to hook any custom
persistent layer (local file, SharedPreferences, key-value based database, etc.). Here is a
minimal PocketBase SDKs initialization for React Native (JavaScript) and Flutter (Dart):

JavaScript

Dart

`// Node.js and React Native doesn't have native EventSource implementation
// so in order to use the realtime subscriptions you'll need to load EventSource polyfill,
// for example: npm install react-native-sse --save
import eventsource from 'react-native-sse';
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';
import PocketBase, { AsyncAuthStore } from 'pocketbase';
// load the polyfill
global.EventSource = eventsource;
// initialize the async store
const store = new AsyncAuthStore({
    save:    async (serialized) => AsyncStorage.setItem('pb_auth', serialized),
    initial: AsyncStorage.getItem('pb_auth'),
});
// initialize the PocketBase client
// (it is OK to have a single/global instance for the duration of your application)
const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090', store);
...
await pb.collection('users').authWithPassword('test@example.com', '1234567890');
console.log(pb.authStore.record)`

`import 'package:pocketbase/pocketbase.dart';
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';
// for simplicity we are using a simple SharedPreferences instance
// but you can also replace it with its safer EncryptedSharedPreferences alternative
final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
// initialize the async store
final store = AsyncAuthStore(
save:    (String data) async => prefs.setString('pb_auth', data),
initial: prefs.getString('pb_auth'),
);
// initialize the PocketBase client
// (it is OK to have a single/global instance for the duration of your application)
final pb = PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090', authStore: store);
...
await pb.collection('users').authWithPassword('test@example.com', '1234567890');
print(pb.authStore.record);`

**[React Native file upload on Android and iOS](https://pocketbase.io/docs/how-to-use/#react-native-file-upload-on-android-and-ios)**

At the time of writing, React Native on Android and iOS seems to have a non-standard
`FormData` implementation and for uploading files on these platforms it requires the following
special object syntax:

`{
uri: "...",
type: "...",
name: "..."
}`

Or in other words, you may have to apply a conditional handling similar to:

`const data = new FormData();
// result is the resolved promise of ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync
let imageUri = result.assets[0].uri;
if (Platform.OS === 'web') {
const req = await fetch(imageUri);
const blob = await req.blob();
data.append('avatar', blob); // regular File/Blob value
} else {
// the below object format works only on Android and iOS
// (FormData.set() also doesn't seem to be supported so we use FormData.append())
data.append('avatar', {
    uri:  imageUri,
    type: 'image/*',
    name: imageUri.split('/').pop(),
});
}
...
await pb.collection('example').create(data)`

The next couple pages have a little bit more information about the basic PocketBase components like
collections, records, authentication, relations, files handling, etc.
